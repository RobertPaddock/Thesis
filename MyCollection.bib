abstract = {High Density Carbon (HDC) is a leading candidate as an ablator material for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) capsules in x-ray (indirect) drive implosions. HDC has a higher density (3.5 g/cc) than plastic (CH, 1 g/cc), which results in a thinner ablator with a larger inner radius for a given capsule scale. This leads to higher x-ray absorption and shorter laser pulses compared to equivalent CH designs. This paper will describe a series of experiments carried out to examine the feasibility of using HDC as an ablator using both gas filled hohlraums and lower density, near vacuum hohlraums. These experiments have shown that deuterium (DD) and deuterium-tritium gas filled HDC capsules driven by a hohlraum filled with 1.2 mg/cc He gas, produce neutron yields a factor of 2× higher than equivalent CH implosions, representing better than 50{\%} Yield-over-Clean (YoC). In a near vacuum hohlraum (He = 0.03 mg/cc) with 98{\%} laser-to-hohlraum coupling, such a DD gas-filled capsule performed near 1D expectations. A cryogenic layered implosion version was consistent with a fuel velocity = 410 ± 20 km/s with no observed ablator mixing into the hot spot. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {This Letter reports on a series of high-adiabat implosions of cryogenic layered deuterium-tritium (DT) capsules indirectly driven by a "high-foot" laser drive pulse at the National Ignition Facility. High-foot implosions have high ablation velocities and large density gradient scale lengths and are more resistant to ablation-front Rayleigh-Taylor instability induced mixing of ablator material into the DT hot spot. Indeed, the observed hot spot mix in these implosions was low and the measured neutron yields were typically 50{\%} (or higher) of the yields predicted by simulation. On one high performing shot (N130812), 1.7 MJ of laser energy at a peak power of 350 TW was used to obtain a peak hohlraum radiation temperature of ∼300 eV. The resulting experimental neutron yield was (2.4±0.05)×1015 DT, the fuel $\rho$R was (0.86±0.063) g/cm2, and the measured Tion was (4.2±0.16) keV, corresponding to 8 kJ of fusion yield, with ∼1/3 of the yield caused by self-heating of the fuel by $\alpha$ particles emitted in the initial reactions. The generalized Lawson criteria, an ignition metric, was 0.43 and the neutron yield was ∼70{\%} of the value predicted by simulations that include $\alpha$-particle self-heating. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Direct-drive-implosion experiments on the OMEGA laser [T. R. Boehly, Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] have showed discrepancies between simulations of the scattered (non-absorbed) light levels and measured ones that indicate the presence of a mechanism that reduces laser coupling efficiency by 10{\%}-20{\%}. This appears to be due to crossed-beam energy transfer (CBET) that involves electromagnetic-seeded, low-gain stimulated Brillouin scattering. CBET scatters energy from the central portion of the incoming light beam to outgoing light, reducing the laser absorption and hydrodynamic efficiency of implosions. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including CBET show good agreement with all observables in implosion experiments on OMEGA. Three strategies to mitigate CBET and improve laser coupling are considered: the use of narrow beams, multicolor lasers, and higher-Z ablators. Experiments on OMEGA using narrow beams have demonstrated improvements in implosion performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The yield and fuel compression trends for the NIF indirect-drive cryogenically-layered DT implosions is empirically examined across all ablators (CH, C and Be) and design in-flight adiabats between 1.5 and 3. Higher compression is observed for a lower design adiabat. Within a design adiabat, compression increases for shorter coast implosions but only if have optimized shock timing. The sensitivity of compression to coast time appears less for higher adiabat designs. Across all designs and ablators, the best DT neutron yields follow the same 1D theoretical curve versus peak velocity, but only if normalize by capsule scale rather than fuel mass and thickness. Shots with reduced yields can be explained by having long coast time, high hot spot mix or know capsule imperfections. Repeat “Standard Candle” shock timing and gas implosions, and DT layered implosions normalized for scale and velocity, reveal adequate reproducibility in shock timing, implosion drive symmetry, compression and yield for the majority of shots. The level of reproducibility is also consistent with known uncertainties and imperfections in initial laser and capsule parameters and outputs. We thus conclude there is no evidence of a significant random unknown variable in these NIF implosions. The scaled yield reproducibility is such that the effect of design improvements increasing yield on any given shot by at least 40{\%} can be deemed statistically significant.},

The purpose of the present experiment is to determine the preheat level due to these electrons, using the K$\alpha$ emission from a two-layer, Ti-V, planar target. The target is designed to separate the contributions of fast electrons and radiation to the observed K$\alpha$ intensity. About 0.3{\%} of the incident laser energy is found to be deposited as preheat due to fast electrons.

abstract = {The effects of two types of target mounts, stalks and spider silks, on the implosion of both room-temperature D2 -gas-filled shells and cryogenic D2 -ice-filled shells have been studied both experimentally and by means of two-dimensional simulations. The simulations indicate that the hydrodynamic effect of the expanding plasma created by the ablation of material from the target mounts and refraction of laser light by this plasma induce perturbations in the imploding shell that are damaging to the implosion. The spider silks are the more-damaging type of mount since the silks (typically four) are arrayed over the target surface, whereas the stalk (typically one) meets the target at a single point. Stalks are therefore preferred over silks as a target mount. The scale and magnitude of the perturbations induced by the spider silks have been verified by planar-target experiments performed on the OMEGA laser [T. R. Boehly, D. L. Brown, R. S. Craxton, Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1995)].

abstract = {Low-mode asymmetries have emerged as one of the primary challenges to achieving high-performing inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions. In direct-drive ICF, an important potential seed of such asymmetries is the capsule stalk mount, the impact of which has remained a contentious question. In this paper, we describe the results from an experiment on the OMEGA laser with intentional offsets at varying angles to the capsule stalk mount, which clearly demonstrates the impact of the stalk mount on implosion dynamics. The angle between stalk and offset is found to significantly impact observables. Specifically, a larger directional flow is observed in neutron spectrum measurements when the offset is toward rather than away from the stalk, while an offset at 42° to the stalk gives minimal directional flow but still generates a large flow field in the implosion. No significant directional flow is seen due to stalk only. Time-integrated X-ray images support these flow observations. A trend is also seen in implosion yield, with lower yield obtained for offsets with a smaller angle than with a larger angle toward the stalk. Radiation hydrodynamic simulations using 2D DRACO and 2D/3D Chimera not including the stalk mount and using 2D xRAGE including the stalk mount are brought to bear on the data. The yield trend, the minimal directional flow with stalk only, and the larger flow enhancement observed with the offset toward the stalk are all reproduced in the xRAGE simulations. The results strongly indicate that the stalk impact must be considered and mitigated to achieve high-performing implosions.},

@article{Hammel2018a,
abstract = {In indirectly driven Inertial Confinement Fusion implosions conducted on the National Ignition Facility (NIF), the imploding capsule is supported in a laser-heated radiation enclosure (called a “hohlraum”) by a pair of very thin (∼15-45 nm) plastic films (referred to as a “tent”). Even though the thickness of these tents is a small fraction of that of the spherical capsule ablator (∼165 $\mu$m), both numerical simulations as well as experiments indicate that this capsule support mechanism results in a large areal density ($\rho$R) perturbation on the capsule surface at the contact point where the tent departs from the capsule. As a result, during deceleration of the deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel layer, a jet of the dense ablator material penetrates and cools the fuel hot spot, significantly degrading the neutron yield (resulting in only ∼10{\%}-20{\%} of the unperturbed 1-D yield). In this article, we present a hypothesis and supporting design simulations of a new “polar contact” tent support system, which reduces the contact area between the tent and the capsule and results in a significant improvement in the capsule performance. Simulations predict a ∼70{\%} increase in neutron yield over that for an implosion with a traditional tent support. An initial demonstration experiment was conducted on the NIF and produced highest ever recorded primary DT neutron yield among all layered DT implosions with plastic ablators on the NIF, though more experiments are needed to comprehensively study the effect of the polar tent on implosion performance.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the results of high-resolution simulations of the implosion of high-convergence layered indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion capsules of the type fielded on the National Ignition Facility using the xRAGE radiation-hydrodynamics code. In order to evaluate the suitability of xRAGE to model such experiments, we benchmark simulation results against available experimental data, including shock-timing, shock-velocity, and shell trajectory data, as well as hydrodynamic instability growth rates. We discuss the code improvements that were necessary in order to achieve favorable comparisons with these data. Due to its use of adaptive mesh refinement and Eulerian hydrodynamics, xRAGE is particularly well suited for high-resolution study of multi-scale engineering features such as the capsule support tent and fill tube, which are known to impact the performance of high-convergence capsule implosions. High-resolution two-dimensional (2D) simulations including accurate and well-resolved models for the capsule fill tube, support tent, drive asymmetry, and capsule surface roughness are presented. These asymmetry seeds are isolated in order to study their relative importance and the resolution of the simulations enables the observation of details that have not been previously reported. We analyze simulation results to determine how the different asymmetries affect hotspot reactivity, confinement, and confinement time and how these combine to degrade yield. Yield degradation associated with the tent occurs largely through decreased reactivity due to the escape of hot fuel mass from the hotspot. Drive asymmetries and the fill tube, however, degrade yield primarily via burn truncation, as associated instability growth accelerates the disassembly of the hotspot. Modeling all of these asymmetries together in 2D leads to improved agreement with experiment but falls short of explaining the experimentally observed yield degradation, consistent with previous 2D simulations of such capsules.},

The radiative loss from the localized mix and local cooling of the reacting plasma conditions was quantified using neutron and x-ray images to reconstruct the hot spot conditions during thermonuclear burn. Such localized features arise from ablator material that is injected into the hot spot from the Rayleigh-Taylor growth of capsule surface perturbations, particularly the tube used to fill the capsule with deuterium and tritium fuel. Observations, consistent with analytic estimates, show the degradation to fusion energy production to be linearly proportional to the fraction of the total emission that is associated with injected ablator material and that this radiative loss has been the primary source of variations, of up to 1.6 times, in observed fusion energy production. Reducing the fill tube diameter has increased the ignition metric $\chi$no $\alpha$ from 0.49 to 0.72, 92{\%} of that required to achieve a burning hot spot.},

abstract = {The micrometer-scale tube that fills capsules with thermonuclear fuel in inertial confinement fusion experiments at the National Ignition Facility is also one of the implosion's main degradation sources. It seeds a perturbation that injects the ablator material into the center, radiating away some of the hot-spot energy. This paper discusses how the perturbation arises in experiments using high-density carbon ablators and how the ablator mix interacts once it enters the hot-spot. Both modeling and experiments show an in-flight areal-density perturbation and localized x-ray emission at stagnation from the fill-tube. Simulations suggest that the fill-tube is degrading an otherwise 1D implosion by ∼2×, but when other degradation sources are present, the yield reduction is closer to 20{\%}. Characteristics of the fill-tube assembly, such as the through-hole size and the glue mass, alter the dynamics and magnitude of the degradation. These aspects point the way toward improvements in the design, some of which (smaller diameter fill-tube) have already shown improvements.},

Each capsule, referred to as a "CD Mixcap," is filled with tritium and has a polystyrene (CH) shell with a deuterated polystyrene (CD) layer whose burial depth is varied. In these implosions, fusion reactions between deuterium and tritium ions can occur only in the presence of atomic mix between the gas fill and shell material. The simulations feature accurate models for all known experimental asymmetries and do not employ any adjustable parameters to improve agreement with experimental data. Simulations are performed with the RAGE radiation-hydrodynamics code using an Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) strategy for the hydrodynamics. We obtain good agreement with the experimental data, including the DT/TT neutron yield ratios used to diagnose mix, for all burial depths of the deuterated shell layer. Additionally, simulations demonstrate good agreement with converged simulations employing explicit models for plasma diffusion and viscosity, suggesting that the implicit sub-grid model used in ILES is sufficient to model these processes in these experiments. In our simulations, mixing is driven by short-wavelength asymmetries and longer-wavelength features are responsible for developing flows that transport mixed material towards the center of the hot spot. Mix material transported by this process is responsible for most of the mix (DT) yield even for the capsule with a CD layer adjacent to the tritium fuel. Consistent with our previous results, mix does not play a significant role in TT neutron yield degradation; instead, this is dominated by the displacement of fuel from the center of the implosion due to the development of turbulent instabilities seeded by long-wavelength asymmetries. Through these processes, the long-wavelength asymmetries degrade TT yield more than the DT yield and thus bring DT/TT neutron yield ratios into agreement with experiment. Finally, we present a detailed comparison of the flows in 2D and 3D simulations.},

abstract = {The "High-Foot" platform manipulates the laser pulse-shape coming from the National Ignition Facility laser to create an indirect drive 3-shock implosion that is significantly more robust against instability growth involving the ablator and also modestly reduces implosion convergence ratio. This strategy gives up on theoretical high-gain in an inertial confinement fusion implosion in order to obtain better control of the implosion and bring experimental performance in-line with calculated performance, yet keeps the absolute capsule performance relatively high. In this paper, we will cover the various experimental and theoretical motivations for the high-foot drive as well as cover the experimental results that have come out of the high-foot experimental campaign. At the time of this writing, the high-foot implosion has demonstrated record total deuterium-tritium yields (9.3×1015) with low levels of inferred mix, excellent agreement with implosion simulations, fuel energy gains exceeding unity, and evidence for the "bootstrapping" associated with alpha-particle self-heating. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {High-yield implosions on the National Ignition Facility rely on maintaining low entropy in the deuterium-tritium fuel, quantified by its adiabat, in order to efficiently couple energy to the hot spot through high compression of the fuel layer. We present very-high-resolution xRAGE simulation results that study the impacts of interfacial mixing and the jetting of materials due to surface defects, defects on internal interfaces, voids, and engineering features on fuel layer compression. Defects and voids are typically neglected in implosion simulations due to their small size and three-dimensional geometry. Our results showed that supersonic jets of material arise through weak spots in the shell at peak implosion velocity that prevent uniform compression of the fuel layer even when they do not introduce contaminant into the hot spot. This occurs despite maintaining low fuel entropy, since the formation of the weak spots involves nonradial displacement of fuel mass. In contrast, simulations show that fuel-ablator mixing due to interfacial instabilities has a much smaller impact on compression. We show that defects on interior interfaces of plastic capsules decrease compression by 15{\%} to 25{\%} and interfacial mixing between the ablator and fuel decreases compression by less than 1{\%} for implosions with plastic or high-density carbon (HDC) ablators. For low adiabat implosions, the impact of jetting seeded by the support tent can also decrease the compression by 25{\%}. We demonstrate that the inclusion of interior defects in simulations can explain the inferred compression in two fielded plastic capsule implosions and that the inclusion of voids, for which available characterization has large uncertainties, in simulations of HDC capsule implosions has a qualitatively consistent impact. This mechanism offers a potential explanation for persistently overestimated fuel compression in design simulations of layered implosions on the National Ignition Facility.},

How do these different ablators compare in current and proposed implosion experiments on NIF? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each? This paper compares these different ablator options in capsule-only simulations of current NIF experiments and potential future designs. The simulations compare the impact of the capsule fill tube, support tent, and interface surface roughness for each case, as well as all perturbations in combination. According to the simulations, each ablator is impacted by the various perturbation sources differently, and each material poses unique challenges in the pursuit of ignition on NIF.},

Plasmas 20, 070501 (2013)PHPAEN1070-664X10.1063/1.4816115] point design implosion has achieved DT neutron yields of 7.5×1014 neutrons, inferred stagnation pressures of 103 Gbar, and inferred areal densities ($\rho$R) of 0.90 g/cm2 (shot N111215), values that are lower than 1D expectations by factors of 10×, 3.3×, and 1.5×, respectively. In this Letter, we present the design basis for an inertial confinement fusion capsule using an alternate indirect-drive pulse shape that is less sensitive to issues that may be responsible for this lower than expected performance. This new implosion features a higher radiation temperature in the "foot" of the pulse, three-shock pulse shape resulting in an implosion that has less sensitivity to the predicted ionization state of carbon, modestly lower convergence ratio, and significantly lower ablation Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth than that of the NIC point design capsule. The trade-off with this new design is a higher fuel adiabat that limits both fuel compression and theoretical capsule yield. The purpose of designing this capsule is to recover a more ideal one-dimensional implosion that is in closer agreement to simulation predictions. Early experimental results support our assertions since as of this Letter, a high-foot implosion has obtained a record DT yield of 2.4×1015 neutrons (within ∼70{\%} of 1D simulation) with fuel $\rho$R=0.84 g/cm2 and an estimated ∼1/3 of the yield coming from $\alpha$-particle self-heating. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Direct-drive, Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) growth experiments were performed using planar plastic targets on the OMEGA Laser Facility [T. R. Boehly, Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] at laser intensities between ∼2× 1014 and ∼1.5×1015 W/cm2. The primary purpose of the experiments was to test fundamental physics in hydrocodes at the range of drive intensities relevant to ignition designs. The target acceleration was measured with a streak camera using side-on, x-ray radiography, while RT growth was measured with a framing camera using face-on radiography. In a laser-intensity range from 2 to 5×1014 W/cm2, the measured RT growth agrees well with two-dimensional simulations, based on a local model of thermal-electron transport. The RT growth at drive intensities above ∼1.0×1015 W/cm2 was strongly stabilized compared to the local model predictions. The experiments demonstrate that standard simulations, based on a local model of electron thermal transport, break down at peak intensities of ignition designs, although they work well at lower intensities. These results also imply that direct-drive ignition targets are significantly more stable than previously calculated using local electron-transport models at peak intensities of ignition designs. The preheating effects by nonlocal electron transport and hot electrons were identified as some of the stabilizing mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The thin membrane that holds the capsule in-place in the hohlraum is recognized as one of the most significant contributors to reduced performance in indirect drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments on the National Ignition Facility. This membrane, known as the “tent,” seeds a perturbation that is amplified by Rayleigh-Taylor and can rupture the capsule. A less damaging capsule support mechanism is under development. Possible alternatives include the micron-scale rods spanning the hohlraum width and supporting either the capsule or stiffening the fill-tube, a larger fill-tube to both fill and support the capsule, or a low-density foam layer that protects the capsule from the tent impact. Experiments are testing these support features to measure their imprint on the capsule. These experiments are revealing unexpected aspects about perturbation development in indirect drive ICF, such as the importance of shadows coming from bright spots in the hohlraum. Two dimensional and 3D models are used to explain these features and assess the impact on implosion performance. Experiments and modeling suggest that the fill-tube supported by a perpendicular rod can mount the capsule without any additional perturbation beyond that of the fill tube.},

abstract = {Ignition requires precisely controlled, high convergence implosions to assemble a dense shell of deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel with R∼1 gcm 2 surrounding a 10 keV hot spot with R ∼ 0.3 gcm2. A working definition of ignition has been a yield of ∼1 MJ. At this yield the -particle energy deposited in the fuel would have been ∼200 kJ, which is already ∼10 more than the kinetic energy of a typical implosion. The National Ignition Campaign includes low yield implosions with dudded fuel layers to study and optimize the hydrodynamic assembly of the fuel in a diagnostics rich environment. The fuel is a mixture of tritium-hydrogen-deuterium (THD) with a density equivalent to DT. The fraction of D can be adjusted to control the neutron yield. Yields of ∼1014-15 14 MeV (primary) neutrons are adequate to diagnose the hot spot as well as the dense fuel properties via down scattering of the primary neutrons. X-ray imaging diagnostics can function in this low yield environment providing additional information about the assembled fuel either by imaging the photons emitted by the hot central plasma, or by active probing of the dense shell by a separate high energy short pulse flash. The planned use of these targets and diagnostics to assess and optimize the assembly of the fuel and how this relates to the predicted performance of DT targets is described. It is found that a good predictor of DT target performance is the THD measurable parameter, Experimental Ignition Threshold Factor, ITFX ∼ Y dsf 2.3, where Y is the measured neutron yield between 13 and 15 MeV, and dsf is the down scattered neutron fraction defined as the ratio of neutrons between 10 and 12 MeV and those between 13 and 15 MeV. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

Plasmas 21, 056314 (2014)] on the National Ignition Facility laser, we have nearly doubled the neutron yield and the hotspot pressure as compared to the implosions reported upon last year. The implosion velocity has been increased using a combination of the laser (higher power and energy), the hohlraum (depleted uranium wall material with higher opacity and lower specific heat than gold hohlraums), and the capsule (thinner capsules with less mass). We find that the neutron yield from these experiments scales systematically with a velocity-like parameter of the square root of the laser energy divided by the ablator mass. By connecting this parameter with the inferred implosion velocity (v), we find that for shots with primary yield {\textgreater}1 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}15{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} neutrons, the total yield ∼ v{\textless}sup{\textgreater}9.4{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This increase is considerably faster than the expected dependence for implosions without alpha heating (∼ v{\textless}sup{\textgreater}5.9{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and is additional evidence that these experiments have significant alpha heating.},

An overall ignition parameter including pressure, confinement time, and temperature is derived to complement the product P$\tau$. A metric for performance assessment should include both and P$\tau$. The ignition parameter and the product P$\tau$ are compared between inertial and magnetic-confinement fusion. It is found that cryogenic implosions on OMEGA [T. R. Boehly, Opt.

Energetic laser pulses are capable of compressing preformed plasma gradients over short times, while accelerating low-density plasma backward. As light is absorbed on a steepened interface, hot-electron temperature and coupling efficiency drop below the ponderomotive scaling and we are left with an absorption mechanism that strongly relies on the electrostatic potential caused by low-density preformed plasma. We describe this process, discuss properties of the resulting electron spectra and identify the parameter regime where strong compression occurs. Finally, we discuss implications for fast ignition and other applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Reaching ignition in direct-drive (DD) inertial confinement fusion implosions requires achieving central pressures in excess of 100 Gbar. The OMEGA laser system [T. R. Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] is used to study the physics of implosions that are hydrodynamically equivalent to the ignition designs on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [J. A. Paisner et al., Laser Focus World 30, 75 (1994)]. It is shown that the highest hot-spot pressures (up to 40 Gbar) are achieved in target designs with a fuel adiabat of $\alpha$ ≈ 4, an implosion velocity of 3.8 × 107 cm/s, and a laser intensity of ∼1015 W/cm2. These moderate-adiabat implosions are well understood using two-dimensional hydrocode simulations. The performance of lower-adiabat implosions is significantly degraded relative to code predictions, a common feature between DD implosions on OMEGA and indirect-drive cryogenic implosions on the NIF. Simplified theoretical models are developed to gain physical understanding of the implosion dynamics that dictate the target performance. These models indicate that degradations in the shell density and integrity (caused by hydrodynamic instabilities during the target acceleration) coupled with hydrodynamics at stagnation are the main failure mechanisms in low-adiabat designs. To demonstrate ignition hydrodynamic equivalence in cryogenic implosions on OMEGA, the target-design robustness to hydrodynamic instability growth must be improved by reducing laser-coupling losses caused by cross beam energy transfer. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The noise floor of this diagnostic was determined to be 0.24 rad with a shot on elastically compressed sapphire. The diagnostic was then applied to two heterogeneous plastic bonded explosives: 3,3′- diaminoazoxyfurazan (DAAF) and PBX 9501, where significant spatial velocity heterogeneity was observed during the build up to detonation. In PBX 9501, the velocity heterogeneity was consistent with the explosive grain size, however in DAAF, we observed heterogeneity on a much larger length scale than the grain size that was similar to the imaging resolution of the instrument. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {It is shown by means of multi-fluid particle-in-cell simulations that convergence of the spherical shock wave that propagates through the inner gas of inertial confinement fusion-relevant experiments is accompanied by a separation of deuterium (D) and tritium (T) ions across the shock front. Deuterons run ahead of the tritons due to their lower mass and higher charge-to-mass ratio and can reach the center several tens of picoseconds before the tritons. The rising edge of the DD and TT fusion rate is also temporally separated by the same amount, which should be an observable in experiments and would be a direct proof of the "stratification conjecture" on the shock front [Amendt, Phys. Plasmas 18, 056308 (2011)]. Moreover, dephasing of the D and T shock components in terms of density and temperature leads to a degradation of the DT fusion yield as the converging shock first rebounds from the fuel center (shock yield). For the parameters of this study, the second peak in the fusion yield (compression yield) is strongly dependent on the choice of the flux limiter. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

Silica (SiO 2) is of primary importance as a key component of rocky planets' mantles. Dynamic compression is the most promising approach to explore molten silicates under extreme conditions. Although most experimental studies are restricted to the Hugoniot curve, a wider range of conditions must be reached to distill temperature and pressure effects. Here we present direct measurements of equation of state and two-colour reflectivity of double-shocked $\alpha$-quartz on a large ensemble of thermodynamic conditions, which were until now unexplored. Combining experimental reflectivity data with numerical simulations we determine the electrical conductivity. The latter is almost constant with pressure while highly dependent on temperature, which is consistent with simulations results. Based on our findings, we conclude that dynamo processes are likely in Super-Earths' mantles.},

We report the results of 125 plate impact shock compression experiments on fused silica spanning 200-1100 GPa using the Z machine at Sandia National Laboratories. Additionally, we present a complementary set of density functional theory based molecular dynamics calculations based on an amorphous reference state that extend the Hugoniot to 2500 GPa. We find good agreement between the Z data, extant laser driven shock compression experiment data, and computational results over most of the pressure range. With these results, fused silica can be used as a new impedance matching standard for shock compression experiments.},

@article{Christopherson2020,
abstract = {A detailed analytic model is presented here to investigate the physics of burn propagation in inertially confined plasmas. The onset of ignition and burn propagation occurs when alpha heating of the hot spot causes rapid ablation of shell mass into the hot spot. This allows large energy gains to be achieved since most of the fuel mass is located in the shell. Here, we first present a comprehensive review of previous analytic models that have been used to describe the physics of hot-spot evolution and ignition; we then show that a proper description of a propagating burn wave requires a comprehensive model of hot spot and shell evolution that includes proper mass conservation in the shell, fusion reactivity, and fuel depletion. The analytic theory is in good agreement with detailed radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that predict the onset of burn propagation as occurring when the yield enhancement caused by alpha heating is between 15- and 25-fold, f$\alpha$ ∼1.4, where f$\alpha$ = alpha energy deposited/hot-spot energy at bang time, and the hot-spot burnup fraction is approximately 2{\%}. We show that the definition of ignition is not sensitive to the alpha-particle stopping power nor asymmetries provided that the absorbed fraction of alpha particles $\theta$$\alpha$ is correctly accounted for. Finally, we use the results of 2-D simulations to show that even when $\theta$$\alpha$ is small and unknown (as is true in hot spots with mid modes that have significant leakage of alpha particles into the surrounding cold bubbles), one can still relate the experimentally measureable parameter $\chi$ $\alpha$ 53 to the yield amplification and the burning-plasma parameter Q $\alpha$ hs = alpha energy deposited/total input work delivered to the hot spot.},

These implosions use hohlraums irradiated with shaped laser pulses of 1.5-1.9 MJ energy.

We quantify the level of hydrodynamic instability mix of the ablator into the hot spot from the measured elevated absolute x-ray emission of the hot spot. We observe that DT neutron yield and ion temperature decrease abruptly as the hot spot mix mass increases above several hundred ng. The comparison with radiation-hydrodynamic modeling indicates that low mode asymmetries and increased ablator surface perturbations may be responsible for the current performance. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

Plasmas 11, 339 (2004) are underway with the goal of compressing deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel to a sufficiently high areal density (R) to sustain a self-propagating burn wave required for fusion power gain greater than unity. These implosions are driven with a carefully tailored sequence of four shock waves that must be timed to very high precision in order to keep the DT fuel on a low adiabat. Initial experiments to measure the strength and relative timing of these shocks have been conducted on NIF in a specially designed surrogate target platform known as the keyhole target. This target geometry and the associated diagnostics are described in detail. The initial data are presented and compared with numerical simulations. As the primary goal of these experiments is to assess and minimize the adiabat in related DT implosions, a methodology is described for quantifying the adiabat from the shock velocity measurements. Results are contrasted between early experiments that exhibited very poor shock timing and subsequent experiments where a modified target geometry demonstrated significant improvement. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The popularity of Bayesian optimization methods for efficient exploration of parameter spaces has lead to a series of papers applying Gaussian processes as surrogates in the optimization of functions. However, most proposed approaches only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available. These could either be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized. Batch methods, however, require the modeling of the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate this issue and propose a highly effective heuristic based on an estimate of the func-tion's Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction-local repulsion-at negligible computational overhead. A penalized acquisition function is used to collect batches of points minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The resulting algorithm compares very well, in run-time, with much more elaborate alternatives.},

When compared with the widely used SESAME-EOS table, the first-principles equation of state (FPEOS) of CH has shown significant differences in the low-temperature regime, in which strong coupling and electron degeneracy play an essential role in determining plasma properties. Hydrodynamic simulations of cryogenic target implosions on OMEGA using the FPEOS table of CH have predicted ∼30{\%} decrease in neutron yield in comparison with the usual SESAME simulations. This is attributed to the ∼5{\%} reduction in implosion velocity that is caused by the ∼10{\%} lower mass ablation rate of CH predicted by FPEOS.

abstract = {$\alpha$-quartz has been used prolifically in recent years as an impedance matching standard in the multimegabar regime (1 Mbar = 100 GPa). This is due to the fact that above ∼90-100 GPa along the principal Hugoniot $\alpha$-quartz becomes reflective, and thus shock velocities can be measured to high precision using velocity interferometry. This property allows for high-precision measurements, however, the accuracy of impedance matching measurements depends upon the knowledge of both the Hugoniot and the release or reshock response of $\alpha$-quartz. Here, we present the results of several adiabatic release measurements of $\alpha$-quartz from ∼300-1200 GPa states along the principal Hugoniot using full density polymethylpentene (commonly known as TPX), and both ∼190 and ∼110 mg/cc silica aerogel standards. These data were analyzed within the framework of a simple, analytical model that was motivated by a first-principles molecular dynamics investigation into the release response of $\alpha$-quartz. Combined, this theoretical and experimental study provides a method to perform impedance matching calculations without the need to appeal to any tabular equation of state for $\alpha$-quartz. As an analytical model, this method allows for propagation of all uncertainty, including the random measurement uncertainties and the systematic uncertainties of the Hugoniot and release response of $\alpha$-quartz. This work establishes $\alpha$-quartz for use as a high-precision standard for impedance matching in the multimegabar regime. We also note that the experimentally validated model framework should prove to be useful in the development of wide range equations of state for silica, a major constituent in the Earth's crust and mantle. Such models are crucial for accurate simulations of high-velocity giant impacts that are thought to be prevalent in the final stages of terrestrial planet formation. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

For optimal coupling, the focal spot of the laser would continuously decrease to match the reduction in the pellet's diameter, thereby minimizing wasted energy. A krypton-fluoride laser ($\lambda$ = 248 nm) that incorporates beam smoothing by induced spatial incoherence has the ability to produce a high quality focal profile whose diameter varies with time, a property known as focal zooming. A two-stage focal zoom has been demonstrated on the Nike laser at the Naval Research Laboratory. In the experiment, a 4.4 ns laser pulse was created in which the on-target focal spot diameter was 1.3 mm (full width at half maximum) for the first 2.4 ns and 0.28 mm for the final 2 ns. These two diameters appear in time-integrated focal plane equivalent images taken at several locations in the amplification chain. Eight of the zoomed output beams were overlapped on a 60 $\mu$m thick planar polystyrene target. Time resolved images of self-emission from the rear of the target show the separate shocks launched by the two corresponding laser focal diameters. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

These experiments were conducted at the US National Ignition Facility, a laser facility delivering up to 1.9 megajoules of energy in pulses with peak powers up to 500 terawatts. We use the lasers to generate X-rays in a radiation cavity to indirectly drive a fuel-containing capsule via the X-ray ablation pressure, which results in the implosion process compressing and heating the fuel via mechanical work. The burning-plasma state was created using a strategy to increase the spatial scale of the capsule2,3 through two different implosion concepts4–7. These experiments show fusion self-heating in excess of the mechanical work injected into the implosions, satisfying several burning-plasma metrics3,8. Additionally, we describe a subset of experiments that appear to have crossed the static self-heating boundary, where fusion heating surpasses the energy losses from radiation and conduction.

@article{Humbird2020,
abstract = {Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments are designed using computer simulations that are approximations of reality and therefore must be calibrated to accurately predict experimental observations. In this article, we propose a novel technique for calibrating from simulations to experiments, or from low fidelity simulations to high fidelity simulations, via 'transfer learning' (TL). TL is a commonly used technique in the machine learning community, in which models trained on one task are partially retrained to solve a separate, but related task, for which there is a limited quantity of data. We introduce the idea of hierarchical TL, in which neural networks trained on low fidelity models are calibrated to high fidelity models, then to experimental data. This technique essentially bootstraps the calibration process, enabling the creation of models which predict high fidelity simulations or experiments with minimal computational cost. We apply this technique to a database of ICF simulations and experiments carried out at the Omega laser facility. TL with deep neural networks enables the creation of models that are more predictive of Omega experiments than simulations alone. The calibrated models accurately predict future Omega experiments, and are used to search for new, optimal implosion designs.},

abstract = {Focusing laser light onto a very small target can produce the conditions for laboratory-scale nuclear fusion of hydrogen isotopes. The lack of accurate predictive models, which are essential for the design of high-performance laser-fusion experiments, is a major obstacle to achieving thermonuclear ignition. Here we report a statistical approach that was used to design and quantitatively predict the results of implosions of solid deuterium–tritium targets carried out with the 30-kilojoule OMEGA laser system, leading to tripling of the fusion yield to its highest value so far for direct-drive laser fusion. When scaled to the laser energies of the National Ignition Facility (1.9 megajoules), these targets are predicted to produce a fusion energy output of about 500 kilojoules—several times larger than the fusion yields currently achieved at that facility. This approach could guide the exploration of the vast parameter space of thermonuclear ignition conditions and enhance our understanding of laser-fusion physics.},

A wavelength-detuning strategy is used to increase absorption and reduce scattered-light losses caused by CBET, allowing for ignition-relevant implosion velocities. Two designs are described: a moderate-adiabat sub-ignition alpha-burning design with a D-T neutron fusion yield of 1.2 × 1017 and a lower-adiabat ignition design with a gain of 27. Both designs have moderate in-flight aspect ratios, indicating acceptable levels of hydrodynamic instability during the implosion.},

abstract = {Ignition and high gain with ultrapowerful lasers* Physics of Plasmas 1, 1626 (1994); https://doi. The 1990 National Academy of Science final report of its review of the Inertial Confinement Fusion Program recommended completion of a series of target physics objectives on the 10-beam Nova laser at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as the highest-priority prerequisite for proceeding with construction of an ignition-scale laser facility, now called the National Ignition Facility NIF. These objectives were chosen to demonstrate that there was sufficient understanding of the physics of ignition targets that the laser requirements for laboratory ignition could be accurately specified. This research on Nova, as well as additional research on the Omega laser at the University of Rochester, is the subject of this review. The objectives of the U.S. indirect-drive target physics program have been to experimentally demonstrate and predictively model hohlraum characteristics, as well as capsule performance in targets that have been scaled in key physics variables from NIF targets. To address the hohlraum and hydrodynamic constraints on indirect-drive ignition, the target physics program was divided into the Hohlraum and Laser-Plasma Physics HLP program and the Hydrodynamically Equivalent Physics HEP program. The HLP program addresses laser-plasma coupling, x-ray generation and transport, and the development of energy-efficient hohlraums that provide the appropriate spectral, temporal, and spatial x-ray drive. The HEP experiments address the issues of hydrodynamic instability and mix, as well as the effects of flux asymmetry on capsules that are scaled as closely as possible to ignition capsules hydrodynamic equivalence. The HEP program also addresses other capsule physics issues associated with ignition, such as energy gain and energy loss to the fuel during implosion in the absence of alpha-particle deposition. The results from the Nova and Omega experiments approach the NIF requirements for most of the important ignition capsule parameters, including drive temperature, drive symmetry, and hydrodynamic instability. This paper starts with a review of the NIF target designs that have formed the motivation for the goals of the target physics program. Following that are theoretical and experimental results from Nova and Omega relevant to the requirements of those targets. Some elements of this work were covered in a 1995 review of indirect-drive J. D. Lindl, ''Development of the indirect-drive approach to inertial confinement fusion and the target physics basis for ignition and gain,'' Phys. Plasmas 2, 3933 1995. In order to present as complete a picture as possible of the research that has been carried out on indirect drive, key elements of that earlier review are also covered here, along with a review of work carried out since 1995.},

The method employs a cold helium-gas-jet shower to uniformly cool a target and an intensity-graded laser illumination to create a desired thermal gradient across the target. The net result is a thermally induced fuel migration inside the target, which precisely counterbalances the gravity-induced fuel sagging, bringing about a uniform layer of fuel condensate on the target interior. This new method is significant for the following reasons: First, it allows for fabrication of both solid- and liquid-fuel layers. Second, it is a noncontact method. Third, it requires either none or very little cryogenic shielding. Fourth, it is simple to implement. Fifth, it allows for easy diagnostic access to the target.

This design uses the indirect drive inertial confinement fusion approach to heat and compress a central "hot spot" of deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel using a surrounding dense DT fuel piston. Ignition occurs when the heating from absorption of $\alpha$ particles created in the fusion process overcomes the loss mechanisms in the system for a duration of time.

abstract = {Magnesium oxide is an important component of the Earth's mantle and has been extensively studied at pressures and temperatures relevant to Earth. However, much less is known about the behaviour of this oxide under conditions likely to occur in extrasolar planets with masses up to 10 times that of Earth, termed super-Earths, where pressures can exceed 1,000 GPa (10 million atmospheres). Magnesium oxide is expected to change from a rocksalt crystal structure (B1) to a caesium chloride (B2) structure at pressures of about 400-600 GPa (refs,). Whereas no structural transformation was observed in static compression experiments up to 250 GPa (ref.), evidence for a solid-solid phase transition was obtained in shockwave experiments above 400 GPa and 9,000 K (ref.), albeit no structural measurements were made. As a result, the properties and the structure of MgO under conditions relevant to super-Earths and large planets are unknown. Here we present dynamic X-ray diffraction measurements of ramp-compressed magnesium oxide. We show that a solid-solid phase transition, consistent with a transformation to the B2 structure, occurs near 600 GPa. On further compression, this structure remains stable to 900 GPa. Our results provide an experimental benchmark to the equations of state and transition pressure of magnesium oxide, and may help constrain mantle viscosity and convection in the deep mantle of extrasolar super-Earths.},

abstract = {Experiments on the National Ignition Facility show that multi-dimensional effects currently dominate the implosion performance. Low mode implosion symmetry and hydrodynamic instabilities seeded by capsule mounting features appear to be two key limiting factors for implosion performance. One reason these factors have a large impact on the performance of inertial confinement fusion implosions is the high convergence required to achieve high fusion gains. To tackle these problems, a predictable implosion platform is needed meaning experiments must trade-off high gain for performance. LANL has adopted three main approaches to develop a one-dimensional (1D) implosion platform where 1D means measured yield over the 1D clean calculation. A high adiabat, low convergence platform is being developed using beryllium capsules enabling larger case-To-capsule ratios to improve symmetry. The second approach is liquid fuel layers using wetted foam targets. With liquid fuel layers, the implosion convergence can be controlled via the initial vapor pressure set by the target fielding temperature. The last method is double shell targets. For double shells, the smaller inner shell houses the DT fuel and the convergence of this cavity is relatively small compared to hot spot ignition. However, double shell targets have a different set of trade-off versus advantages. Details for each of these approaches are described.},

Emphasis is on the range of moderate compression that can be produced by high-velocity impact or detonation of chemical exp- sives and in which elastoplastic responses are observed and simple equations of state are applicable. In the interest of simplicity, the presentation is restricted to plane waves producing uniaxial deformation. Although applications often - volve complex multidimensional deformation fields it is necessary to begin with the simpler case. This is also the most important case because it is the usual setting of experimental research. The presentation is also restricted to theories of material response that are simple enough to permit illustrative problems to be solved with minimal recourse to numerical analysis. The discussions are set in the context of established continuum-mechanical principles. I have endeavored to define the quantities encountered with some care and to provide equations in several convenient forms and in a way that lends itself to easy reference. Thermodynamic analysis plays an important role in continuum mechanics, and I have included a presentation of aspects of this subject that are particularly relevant to shock physics. The notation adopted is that conventional in expositions of modern continuum mechanics, insofar as possible, and variables are explained as they are encountered. Those experienced in shock physics may find some of the notation unconventional.},

Because of its bandwidth of 1 THz FWHM (full width at half‐maximum), Nike produces more uniform focal distributions than any other high‐energy ultraviolet laser.

abstract = {Low-density foams of low-/mid-Z materials have been previously proposed to mitigate laser imprint for direct-drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF). For foam densities above the critical density of the drive laser, the mechanism of laser-imprint mitigation relies on the reduced growth rate of Rayleigh-Taylor instability because of the increased ablation velocity and density scale length at the ablation surface. Experimental demonstration of this concept has been limited so far to planar-target geometry. The impact of foams on spherical implosions has not yet been explored in experiments. To examine the viability of using an above-critical-density foam layer to mitigate laser-imprint effects in direct-drive ICF implosions on OMEGA, we have performed a series of 2-D DRACO simulations with state-of-the-art physics models, including nonlocal thermal transport, cross-beam energy transfer, and first-principles equation-of-state tables. The simulation results indicate that a 40-$\mu$m-thick CH or SiO2 foam layer with a density of $\rho$ = 40 mg/cm3 added to a D2-filled polystyrene (CH) capsule can significantly improve the moderate-adiabat ($\alpha$ ≈ 3) implosion performance. In comparison to the standard CH target implosion, an increase in neutron yield by a factor of 4 to 8 and the recovery of 1-D compression $\rho$R are predicted by DRACO simulations for a foam-target surface roughness of $\sigma$rms ≤ 0.5 $\mu$m. These encouraging results could readily facilitate experimental demonstrations of laser-imprint mitigation with an above-critical-density foam layer.},

The CH Hugoniot obtained tends to become stiffer than a semiempirical chemical theoretical model predictions at ultrahigh pressures but is consistent with other models and available experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Computer simulations of high energy density science experiments are computationally challenging, consisting of multiple physics calculations including radiation transport, hydrodynamics, atomic physics, nuclear reactions, laser-plasma interactions, and more. To simulate inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments at high fidelity, each of these physics calculations should be as detailed as possible. However, this quickly becomes too computationally expensive even for modern supercomputers, and thus many simplifying assumptions are made to reduce the required computational time. Much of the research has focused on acceleration techniques for the various packages in multiphysics codes. In this work, we explore a novel method for accelerating physics packages via machine learning. The non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) package is one of the most expensive calculations in the simulations of indirect drive inertial confinement fusion, taking several tens of percent of the total wall clock time. We explore the use of machine learning to accelerate this package, by essentially replacing the physics calculation with a deep neural network that has been trained to emulate the physics code. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on a simple problem and perform a side-by-side comparison of the physics calculation and the neural network inline in an ICF Hohlraum simulation. We show that the neural network achieves a 10× speed up in NLTE computational time while achieving good agreement with the physics code for several quantities of interest.},

abstract = {The field of nuclear diagnostics for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) is broadly reviewed from its beginning in the seventies to present day. During this time, the sophistication of the ICF facilities and the suite of nuclear diagnostics have substantially evolved, generally a consequence of the efforts and experience gained on previous facilities. As the fusion yields have increased several orders of magnitude during these years, the quality of the nuclear-fusion-product measurements has improved significantly, facilitating an increased level of understanding about the physics governing the nuclear phase of an ICF implosion. The field of ICF has now entered an era where the fusion yields are high enough for nuclear measurements to provide spatial, temporal and spectral information, which have proven indispensable to understanding the performance of an ICF implosion. At the same time, the requirements on the nuclear diagnostics have also become more stringent. To put these measurements into context, this review starts by providing some historical remarks about the field of ICF and the role of nuclear diagnostics, followed by a brief overview of the basic physics that characterize the nuclear phase and performance of an ICF implosion. A technical discussion is subsequently presented of the neutron, gamma-ray, charged-particle and radiochemistry diagnostics that are, or have been, routinely used in the field of ICF. This discussion is followed by an elaboration of the current view of the next-generation nuclear diagnostics. Since the seventies, the overall progress made in the areas of nuclear diagnostics and scientific understanding of an ICF implosion has been enormous, and with the implementation of new high-fusion-yield facilities world-wide, the next-generation nuclear diagnostics will play an even more important role for decades to come.},

Plasmas 17, 058102 (2010)] is used to assess the performance requirements for cryogenic implosion experiments on the Omega Laser Facility. The theory of hydrodynamic similarity is developed in both one and two dimensions and tested using multimode hydrodynamic simulations with the hydrocode DRACO [P. B. Radha et al., Phys. Plasmas 12, 032702 (2005)] of hydro-equivalent implosions (implosions with the same implosion velocity, adiabat, and laser intensity). The theory is used to scale the performance of direct-drive OMEGA implosions to the National Ignition Facility (NIF) energy scales and determine the requirements for demonstrating hydro-equivalent ignition on OMEGA. Hydro-equivalent ignition on OMEGA is represented by a cryogenic implosion that would scale to ignition on the NIF at 1.8 MJ of laser energy symmetrically illuminating the target. It is found that a reasonable combination of neutron yield and areal density for OMEGA hydro-equivalent ignition is 3 to 6 × 1013 and ∼ 0.3 g/cm2, respectively, depending on the level of laser imprinting. This performance has not yet been achieved on OMEGA. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Following indirect-drive experiments which demonstrated promising performance for low convergence ratios (below 17), previous direct-drive simulations identified a fusion-relevant regime which is expected to be robust to hydrodynamic instability growth. This paper expands these results with simulated implosions at lower energies of 100 and 270 kJ, and 'hydrodynamic equivalent' capsules which demonstrate comparable convergence ratio, implosion velocity and in-flight aspect ratio without the need for cryogenic cooling, which would allow the assumptions of one-dimensional-like performance to be tested on current facilities. A range of techniques to improve performance within this regime are then investigated, including the use of two-colour and deep ultraviolet laser pulses. Finally, further simulations demonstrate that the deposition of electron energy into the hotspot of a low convergence ratio implosion through auxiliary heating also leads to significant increases in yield. Results include break even for 1.1 MJ of total energy input (including an estimated 370 kJ of short-pulse laser energy to produce electron beams for the auxiliary heating), but are found to be highly dependent upon the efficiency with which electron beams can be created and transported to the hotspot to drive the heating mechanism.},

Thick-target electron beam spectra are calculated with a Monte Carlo electron beam transport program and fit to the experimental time-integrated x-ray spectra. A good fit is obtained with a 2-MA E-2 power law electron beam, with cutoff energies at 8 and 200 keV, incident normal to a thick tungsten target. The source of the beam is judged to be electrons which are accelerated under the influence of strong electric fields. A 20-nsec Q-switched ruby laser pulse injected tungsten ions via laser ablation prior to the initial dense pinch, and the x-ray emission below 4 keV was enhanced and that above 10 keV was reduced. The enhanced low-energy x-ray emission is in agreement with calculated radiation for collisional M-shell excitation of highly stripped tungsten in a 1.5-keV thermal plasma. A 900- $\mu$sec ruby laser pulse injected sufficient tungsten ions to degrade greatly the initial dense plasma pinch and reduce the beam target x-ray emission. The time-resolved x-ray emission from this configuration appeared as a smooth Gaussian function in time with FWHM∼200 nsec. {\textcopyright} 1974 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The baseline DT ice layer inertial confinement fusion (ICF) ignition capsule design requires a hot spot convergence ratio of ∼34 with a hot spot that is formed from DT mass originally residing in a very thin layer at the inner DT ice surface. In the present paper, we propose alternative ICF capsule designs in which the hot spot is formed mostly or entirely from mass originating within a spherical volume of DT vapor. Simulations of the implosion and hot spot formation in two DT liquid layer ICF capsule concepts - the DT wetted hydrocarbon (CH) foam concept and the "fast formed liquid" (FFL) concept - are described and compared to simulations of standard DT ice layer capsules. 1D simulations are used to compare the drive requirements, the optimal shock timing, the radial dependence of hot spot specific energy gain, and the hot spot convergence ratio in low vapor pressure (DT ice) and high vapor pressure (DT liquid) capsules. 2D simulations are used to compare the relative sensitivities to low-mode x-ray flux asymmetries in the DT ice and DT liquid capsules. It is found that the overall thermonuclear yields predicted for DT liquid layer capsules are less than yields predicted for DT ice layer capsules in simulations using comparable capsule size and absorbed energy. However, the wetted foam and FFL designs allow for flexibility in hot spot convergence ratio through the adjustment of the initial cryogenic capsule temperature and, hence, DT vapor density, with a potentially improved robustness to low-mode x-ray flux asymmetry. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The second model considers the additional effect created by the mass transfer, namely, the effect of condensation and evaporation.

These capsules substituted an additional thickness of plastic ablator material in place of the cryogenic layer of Deuterium- Tritium (DT) fuel. The present experiments are the first to include a DT ice layer, which enables measurements of the instability growth occurring at the fuel-ablator interface. Instability growth at the fuel-ablator interface is seeded differently in two independent NIF experiments. In the first case, a perturbation on the outside of the capsule feeds through and grows on the interface. Comparisons to an implosion without a fuel layer produce a measure of the fuel's modulation. In the second case, a modulation was directly machined on the inner ablator before the fuel layer was added. The measurement of growth in these two scenarios are compared to 2D rad-hydro modeling.},

Firm low-carbon or zero-carbon resources based on gas-fired turbines with carbon capture, advanced fission reactors, hydroelectric and perhaps engineered geothermal systems will then be used to provide the balance of load in a highly dynamic system operating in competitive markets governed by merit-order pricing mechanisms that select the lowest-cost supplies to meet demand.

In particular, we use the genetic algorithm metaheuristic, in which "populations" of implosions are simulated, the design of the capsule is described by a "genome," natural selection removes poor designs, high quality designs are "mated" with each other based on their yield, and designs undergo "mutations" to introduce new ideas. We show that it takes ∼5 × 104 simulations for the algorithm to find an original NIF design.

abstract = {High-precision measurements of the diamond principal Hugoniot have been made at pressures between 6 and 19 Mbar. Shock velocities were determined with 0.3{\%}-1.1{\%} precision using a velocity interferometer. Impedance-matching analysis, incorporating systematic uncertainties in the equation of state of the quartz standard, was used to determine the Hugoniot with 1.2{\%}-2.7{\%} precision in density. The results are in good agreement with published ab initio calculations, which predict a small negative melt slope along the Hugoniot, but disagree with previous laser-driven shock wave experiments, which had observed a large density increase in the melt region. In the extensive solid-liquid coexistence regime between 6 and 10 Mbar, the present measurements indicate that the mixed phase is a few percent more dense than what would be expected from a simple interpolation between liquid and solid Hugoniots. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

Observations of shock velocity and thermal emission provide complete equation of state data (pressure, density, internal energy, and temperature) in the dense fluid regime up to 175 GPa. This data set is used to benchmark recent advanced ab initio calculations and is seen to be in good agreement with a maximum 8{\%} density difference above 100 GPa. Thermodynamic quantities (specific heat and Gruneisen coefficient) are calculated directly from the data and compared to theory. Optical reflectivity data show a continuous transition from an electrically insulating to conducting fluid state and reveal that this transition is increasingly sensitive to temperature with increasing density.

abstract = {The goal of an inertially confined, igniting plasma on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [M. L. Spaeth, Fusion Sci. Technol. 69, 25 (2016)] remains elusive. However, there is a growing understanding of the factors that appear to be limiting current implosion performance. And with this understanding, the question naturally arises: What conditions will ultimately be required to achieve ignition, either by continuing to improve the quality of current implosions, or by hydrodynamically scaling those implosions to larger driver energies on some future facility? Given the complexity of NIF implosions, answering this question must rely heavily on sophisticated numerical simulations. In particular, those simulations must respect the three-dimensionality of real NIF implosions and also resolve the wide range of scales for the many perturbation sources that degrade them. This prospectus article reviews the current state of detailed modeling of NIF implosions, the scaling to ignition from recent experiments that that modeling implies, and areas for future improvements in modeling technique that could increase understanding and further enhance predictive capabilities. Given the uncertainties inherent in any extrapolation, particularly for a process as nonlinear as ignition, there will be no definitive answer on the requirements for ignition until it is actually demonstrated experimentally. However, with continuing improvements in modeling technique and a growing experience base from NIF, the requirements for ignition are becoming clearer.},

abstract = {A new class of ignition designs is proposed for inertial confinement fusion experiments. These designs are based on the hot-spot ignition approach, but instead of a conventional target that is comprised of a spherical shell with a thin frozen deuterium-tritium (DT) layer, a liquid DT sphere inside a wetted-foam shell is used, and the lower-density central region and higher-density shell are created dynamically by appropriately shaping the laser pulse. These offer several advantages, including simplicity in target production (suitable for mass production for inertial fusion energy), absence of the fill tube (leading to a more-symmetric implosion), and lower sensitivity to both laser imprint and physics uncertainty in shock interaction with the ice-vapor interface. The design evolution starts by launching an ∼1-Mbar shock into a DT sphere. After bouncing from the center, the reflected shock reaches the outer surface of the sphere and the shocked material starts to expand outward. Supporting ablation pressure ultimately stops such expansion and subsequently launches a shock toward the target center, compressing the ablator and fuel, and forming a shell. The shell is then accelerated and fuel is compressed by appropriately shaping the drive laser pulse, forming a hot spot using the conventional or shock ignition approaches. This Letter demonstrates the feasibility of the new concept using hydrodynamic simulations and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the concept compared with more-traditional inertial confinement fusion designs.},

abstract = {Argon fluoride (ArF) is currently the shortest wavelength laser that can credibly scale to the energy and power required for high gain inertial fusion. ArF's deep ultraviolet light and capability to provide much wider bandwidth than other contemporary inertial confinement fusion (ICF) laser drivers would drastically improve the laser target coupling efficiency and enable substantially higher pressures to drive an implosion. Our radiation hydrodynamics simulations indicate gains greater than 100 are feasible with a sub-megajoule ArF driver. Our laser kinetics simulations indicate that the electron beam-pumped ArF laser can have intrinsic efficiencies of more than 16{\%}, versus about 12{\%} for the next most efficient krypton fluoride excimer laser. We expect at least 10{\%} ‘wall plug' efficiency for delivering ArF light to target should be achievable using solid-state pulsed power and efficient electron beam transport to the laser gas that was demonstrated with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory's Electra facility. These advantages could enable the development of modest size and lower cost fusion power plant modules. This would drastically change the present view on inertial fusion energy as being too expensive and the power plant size too large.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Prospects for high gain inertial fusion energy (part 1)'.},

The pulse shapes contain three pickets that precede a sharp rise to a constant laser intensity at ∼4.5× 1014 W/ cm2. The in-flight-aspect-ratio (IFAR), a crucial measure of shell instability to nonuniformity growth, is varied in these implosions by changing picket energies and the timing among the pickets. Simulations that include cross-beam energy transfer in addition to inverse bremsstrahlung for the laser-energy deposition models show better agreement with measurements of the neutron bang time and temporally resolved scattered light and therefore more correctly model the shell kinetic energy. It is also shown that target performance improves significantly as IFAR is reduced. Nearly twice the neutron yield is measured for IFAR∼31 compared to IFAR∼60. The ratio of the measured to simulated neutron yield and areal density increases significantly with decreasing IFAR. These implosions unambiguously link target performance to in-flight shell instability attributable to short-wavelength growth and indicate that IFAR40 is required to achieve adequate compression at this intensity. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

That, combined with high-resolution monochromatic x-ray imaging pioneered at NRL in the 1990s and the recently added two-dimensional (2D) VISAR diagnostics, provides a unique platform for experimental studies of hydrodynamic phenomena important to the inertial confinement fusion (ICF). These include absolute experimental determination of the primary Hugoniots of low-density plastic foams in the Mbar pressure range. Although foam materials have many uses for the manufacturing of ICF targets ranging from laser fusion to Z-pinch-driven dynamic hohlraums, no experimental data on their shock compressibility in the ICF-relevant pressure range was available until our experiments. We describe the first systematic experimental study of the nonlinear, multi-mode perturbation evolution triggered by localized target non-uniformities, such as straight grooves and dots, which emulate fill tubes, tents, and other target-mounting structures in laser capsules. The experimental data turned out to be counter-intuitive and challenging for simulations. Finally, the 2D VISAR snap-shot images of the shock velocity field made it possible to directly measure the roughness of a uniformly driven shock front propagating into the target, which is caused by ISI-smoothed laser imprint. Initial measurements for planar CH targets with and without thin high-Z layers added for the imprint mitigation have been successfully performed.},

abstract = {In order to achieve the several hundred Gbar stagnation pressures necessary for inertial confinement fusion ignition, implosion experiments on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [E. I. Moses et al., Phys. Plasmas 16, 041006 (2009)] require the compression of deuterium-tritium fuel layers by a convergence ratio as high as forty. Such high convergence implosions are subject to degradation by a range of perturbations, including the growth of small-scale defects due to hydrodynamic instabilities, as well as longer scale modulations due to radiation flux asymmetries in the enclosing hohlraum. Due to the broad range of scales involved, and also the genuinely three-dimensional (3D) character of the flow, accurately modeling NIF implosions remains at the edge of current simulation capabilities. This paper describes the current state of progress of 3D capsule-only simulations of NIF implosions aimed at accurately describing the performance of specific NIF experiments. Current simulations include the effects of hohlraum radiation asymmetries, capsule surface defects, the capsule support tent and fill tube, and use a grid resolution shown to be converged in companion two-dimensional simulations. The results of detailed simulations of low foot implosions from the National Ignition Campaign are contrasted against results for more recent high foot implosions. While the simulations suggest that low foot performance was dominated by ablation front instability growth, especially the defect seeded by the capsule support tent, high foot implosions appear to be dominated by hohlraum flux asymmetries, although the support tent still plays a significant role. For both implosion types, the simulations show reasonable, though not perfect, agreement with the data and suggest that a reliable predictive capability is developing to guide future implosions toward ignition.},

abstract = {This book introduces the core concepts of the shock wave physics of condensed matter, taking a continuum mechanics approach to examine liquids and isotropic solids. The text primarily focuses on one-dimensional uniaxial compression in order to show the key features of condensed matter's response to shock wave loading. The first four chapters are specifically designed to quickly familiarize physical scientists and engineers with how shock waves interact with other shock waves or material boundaries, as well as to allow readers to better understand shock wave literature, use basic data analysis techniques, and design simple 1-D shock wave experiments. This is achieved by first presenting the steady one-dimensional strain conservation laws using shock wave impedance matching, which insures conservation of mass, momentum and energy. Here, the initial emphasis is on the meaning of shock wave and mass velocities in a laboratory coordinate system. An overview of basic experimental techniques for measuring pressure, shock velocity, mass velocity, compression and internal energy of steady 1-D shock waves is then presented. In the second part of the book, more advanced topics are progressively introduced: thermodynamic surfaces are used to describe equilibrium flow behavior, first-order Maxwell solid models are used to describe time-dependent flow behavior, descriptions of detonation shock waves in ideal and non-ideal explosives are provided, and lastly, a select group of current issues in shock wave physics are discussed in the final chapter.},

Simulations were used to estimate the sensitivity of target performance to uncertainties and variations in experimental conditions. A formalism is described that evaluates margin for ignition, summarized in a parameter the Ignition Threshold Factor (ITF). Uncertainty and shot-to-shot variability in ITF are evaluated, and sensitivity of the margin to characteristics of the experiment. The formalism is used to estimate probability of ignition. The ignition experiment will be preceded with an experimental campaign that determines features of the design that cannot be defined with simulations alone.

abstract = {Simulation of radiation hydrodynamics in two spatial dimensions is developed, having in mind, in particular, target design for indirectly driven inertial confinement energy (IFE) and the interpretation of related experiments. Intense radiation pulses by laser or particle beams heat high-Z target configurations of different geometries and lead to a regime which is optically thick in some regions and optically thin in others. A diffusion description is inadequate in this situation. A new numerical code has been developed which describes hydrodynamics in two spatial dimensions (cylindrical R - Z geometry) and radiation transport along rays in three dimensions with the 4$\pi$ solid angle discretized in direction. Matter moves on a non-structured mesh composed of trilateral and quadrilateral elements. Radiation flux of a given direction enters on two (one) sides of a triangle and leaves on the opposite side(s) in proportion to the viewing angles depending on the geometry. This scheme allows to propagate sharply edged beams without ray tracing, though at the price of some lateral diffusion. The algorithm treats correctly both the optically thin and optically thick regimes. A symmetric semi-implicit (SSI) method is used to guarantee numerical stability.

External routines: X-window standard library (libX11.so) and corresponding heading files (X11/*.h) are required. Nature of problem: In inertial confinement fusion and related experiments with lasers and particle beams, energy transport by thermal radiation becomes important. Under these conditions, the radiation field strongly interacts with the hydrodynamic motion through emission and absorption processes. Solution method: The equations of radiation transfer coupled with Lagrangian hydrodynamics, heat diffusion and beam tracing (laser or ions) are solved, in two-dimensional axial-symmetric geometry (R - Z coordinates) using a fractional step scheme. Radiation transfer is solved with angular resolution. Matter properties are either interpolated from tables (equations-of-state and opacities) or computed by user routines (conductivities and beam attenuation). Restrictions: The code has been designed for typical conditions prevailing in inertial confinement fusion (ns time scale, matter states close to local thermodynamical equilibrium, negligible radiation pressure, ...). Although a wider range of situations can be treated, extrapolations to regions beyond this design range need special care. Unusual features: A special computer language, called r94, is used at top levels of the code. These parts have to be converted to standard C by a translation program (supplied as part of the package). Due to the complexity of code (hydro-code, grid generation, user interface, graphic post-processor, translator program, installation scripts) extensive manuals are supplied as part of the package.

We developed a method to fabricate these foam-lined ablator shells using a prefabricated ablator as a mold to cast the foam liner within the shell. One crucial component of this new approach is the removal of solvent from the ablator shells without collapsing the ultralow-density porous polymer network. Here, we report on a supercritical drying approach with liquid carbon dioxide that provides critical information on how to produce thin layers of low-density polymer foams in ablator shells for ICF experiments. Diffusion experiments were used to study the time required for complete solvent exchange in 2-mm-inner-diameter diamond shells and the data were used to demonstrate the fabrication of uniform porous polymer films inside ablator shells.},

abstract = {Hydrocarbon foams are versatile materials extensively used in high energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments. However, little data exist above 100 GPa, where knowledge of the behavior is particularly important for designing, analyzing, and optimizing HEDP experiments. The complex internal structure and properties of foam call for a multi-scale modeling effort validated by experimental data. We present results from experiments, classical molecular dynamics simulations, and mesoscale hydrodynamic modeling of poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) (PMP) foams under strong shock compression. Experiments conducted using the Z-machine at Sandia National Laboratories shock compress ∼0.300 g/cm3 density PMP foams to 185 GPa. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations model shock compressed PMP foam and elucidate behavior of the heterogeneous foams at high pressures. The MD results show quantitative agreement with the experimental data, while providing additional information about local temperature and dissociation. Three-dimensional nm-scale hydrocode simulations of the foam show internal structure of pore collapse as well as provide detailed information on the foam state behind the shock front. Finally, the experimental and MD results are compared to continuum hydrodynamics simulations to assess a potential equation of state model for PMP foams to use in large scale hydrodynamics simulations. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

@article{Zhang2020,
abstract = { While major progress has been made in the research of inertial confinement fusion, significant challenges remain in the pursuit of ignition. To tackle the challenges, we propose a double-cone ignition (DCI) scheme, in which two head-on gold cones are used to confine deuterium–tritium (DT) shells imploded by high-power laser pulses. The scheme is composed of four progressive controllable processes: quasi-isentropic compression, acceleration, head-on collision and fast heating of the compressed fuel. The quasi-isentropic compression is performed inside two head-on cones. At the later stage of the compression, the DT shells in the cones are accelerated to forward velocities of hundreds of km s –1 . The head-on collision of the compressed and accelerated fuels from the cone tips transfer the forward kinetic energy to the thermal energy of the colliding fuel with an increased density. The preheated high-density fuel can keep its status for a period of approximately 200 ps. Within this period, MeV electrons generated by ps heating laser pulses, guided by a ns laser-produced strong magnetic field further heat the fuel efficiently. Our simulations show that the implosion inside the head-on cones can greatly mitigate the energy requirement for compression; the collision can preheat the compressed fuel of approximately 300 g cm −3 to a temperature above keV. The fuel can then reach an ignition temperature of greater than 5 keV with magnetically assisted heating of MeV electrons generated by the heating laser pulses. Experimental campaigns to demonstrate the scheme have already begun. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Prospects for high gain inertial fusion energy (part 1)'.},

Although recent experiments approached or exceeded the anticipated ignition thresholds, the nuclear performance of the laser-driven capsules was well below predictions in terms of energy and neutron production. Such discrepancies between expectations and reality motivate a reassessment of the physics of ignition. We have developed a predictive analytical model from fundamental physics principles. Based on the model, we obtained a general thermonuclear ignition criterion in terms of the areal density and temperature of the hot fuel. This newly derived ignition threshold and its alternative forms explicitly show the minimum requirements of the hot fuel pressure, mass, areal density, and burn fraction for achieving ignition. Comparison of our criterion with existing theories, simulations, and the experimental data shows that our ignition threshold is more stringent than those in the existing literature and that our results are consistent with the experiments.},

abstract = {Combining laser beams in a plasma is enabled by seeded stimulated Brillouin scattering which allows cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) to occur and re-distributes the energy between beams that cross with different incident angles and small differences in wavelength [Kirkwood et al. Phys. Plasmas 4, 1800 (1997)]. Indirect-drive implosions at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [Haynam et al. Appl. Opt. 46, 3276-3303 (2007)] have controlled drive symmetry by using plasma amplifiers to transfer energy between beams [Kirkwood et al., Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 55, 103001 (2013); Lindl et al., Phys. Plasmas 21, 020501 (2014); and Hurricane et al. Nature 506, 343-348 (2014)]. In this work, we show that the existing models are well enough validated by experiments to allow a design of a plasma beam combiner that, once optimized, is expected to produce a pulse of light in a single beam with the energy greatly enhanced over existing sources. The scheme combines up to 61 NIF beams with 120 kJ of available energy into a single f/20 beam with a 1 ns pulse duration and a 351 nm wavelength by both resonant and off-resonance CBET. Initial experiments are also described that have already succeeded in producing a 4 kJ, 1 ns pulse in a single beam by combination of up to eight incident pump beams containing {\textless}1.1 kJ/beam, which are maintained near resonance for CBET in a plasma that is formed by 60 pre-heating beams [Kirkwood et al., Nat. Phys. 14, 80 (2018)].},

abstract = {We are developing a new NIF experimental platform that employs wetted foam liquid fuel layer ICF capsules. We will use the liquid fuel layer capsules in a NIF sub-scale experimental campaign to explore the relationship between hot spot convergence ratio (CR) and the predictability of hot spot formation. DT liquid layer ICF capsules allow for flexibility in hot spot CR via the adjustment of the initial cryogenic capsule temperature and, hence, DT vapor density. Our hypothesis is that the predictive capability of hot spot formation is robust and 1D-like for a relatively low CR hot spot (CR∼15), but will become less reliable as hot spot CR is increased to CR{\textgreater}20. Simulations indicate that backing off on hot spot CR is an excellent way to reduce capsule instability growth and to improve robustness to low-mode x-ray flux asymmetries. In the initial experiments, we will test our hypothesis by measuring hot spot size, neutron yield, ion temperature, and burn width to infer hot spot pressure and compare to predictions for implosions with hot spot CR's in the range of 12 to 25. Larger scale experiments are also being designed, and we will advance from sub-scale to full-scale NIF experiments to determine if 1D-like behavior at low CR is retained as the scale-size is increased. The long-term objective is to develop a liquid fuel layer ICF capsule platform with robust thermonuclear burn, modest CR, and significant $\alpha$-heating with burn propagation.},

abstract = {The field-compensation principle, which has been applied to interferometric spectroscopy independently by P. Connes and by L. Mertz, allows the useful solid angle accepted by an interferometer to be increased by an amount that can be very large. This paper is concerned with a particular application of this principle using the Michelson interferometer. Although the technique is difficult to utilize where a wide range of path differences is required, the interferometer takes an extremely simple form when constructed for a narrow range of path difference about a fixed central path difference. While such an instrument has a limited use in spectroscopy, there is one type of measurement which it is admirably suited to perform: the determination of the width of a single isolated atomic line whose analytical shape is known. A description is given of the theory and construction of a wide-angle Michelson interferometer now being used for the measurement of Doppler temperatures from the width of the 5577 {\AA} atomic oxygen line in the nightglow and aurora. This line is known to be accurately gaussian in shape, and is well-isolated from other lines, making it an ideal subject for this instrument.},

abstract = {A detailed and comprehensive 1-dimensional theory of alpha-heating metrics is developed to determine the onset of burning plasma regimes in inertial fusion implosions. The analysis uses an analytic model of the deceleration, stagnation, and burn phases of inertial confinement fusion implosions combined with the results from a database of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. The onset of the burning-plasma regime occurs when the alpha-heating rate in the hot spot exceeds the compression power input and is represented by the parameter Q$\alpha$=1/2 $\alpha$ energy/PdV work. A second burning plasma regime is also identified, where the alpha-heating rate exceeds the compression input to the entire stagnated plasma, including the hot spot and confining shell, and is represented by Q$\alpha$tot. It is shown that progress towards the burning-plasma regime is correlated with the yield enhancement caused by alpha-heating but is more accurately related to the fractional alpha energy f$\alpha$=1/2 $\alpha$ energy/hot-spot energy. In the analysis presented here, we develop a method to infer these intermediate metrics from experiments and show that the alpha power produced in National Ignition Facility High-Foot implosions is approximately 50{\%} of the external input power delivered to the hot spot and 25{\%} of the total external power (from compression) delivered to the stagnated core.},

Our studies, together with neutron image analysis, reveal that the adiabats of the cold fuel in both low-foot and high-foot experiments are similar. That is, the cold deuterium-tritium shells in those experiments are all in a high adiabat state at the time of peak implosion velocity. The major difference between low-foot and high-foot capsule experiments is the growth of the shock-induced instabilities developed at the material interfaces which lead to fuel mixing with ablator material. Furthermore, we have compared the NIF capsules performance with the ignition criteria and analyzed the alpha particle heating in the NIF experiments. Our analysis shows that alpha heating was appreciable only in the high-foot experiments.},

abstract = {Laser-direct drive (LDD), along with laser indirect (X-ray) drive (LID) and magnetic drive with pulsed power, is one of the three viable inertial confinement fusion approaches to achieving fusion ignition and gain in the laboratory. The LDD programme is primarily being executed at both the Omega Laser Facility at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics and at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. LDD research at Omega includes cryogenic implosions, fundamental physics including material properties, hydrodynamics and laser–plasma interaction physics. LDD research on the NIF is focused on energy coupling and laser–plasma interactions physics at ignition-scale plasmas. Limited implosions on the NIF in the ‘polar-drive' configuration, where the irradiation geometry is configured for LID, are also a feature of LDD research. The ability to conduct research over a large range of energy, power and scale size using both Omega and the NIF is a major positive aspect of LDD research that reduces the risk in scaling from OMEGA to megajoule-class lasers. The paper will summarize the present status of LDD research and plans for the future with the goal of ultimately achieving a burning plasma in the laboratory.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Prospects for high gain inertial fusion energy (part 2)'.},

abstract = {Measuring the width of the energy spectrum of fusion-produced neutrons from deuterium (DD) or deuterium-tritium (DT) plasmas is a commonly used method for determining the ion temperature in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions. In a plasma with a Maxwellian distribution of ion energies, the spread in neutron energy arises from the thermal spread in the center-of-mass velocities of reacting pairs of ions. Fluid velocities in ICF are of a similar magnitude as the center-of-mass velocities and can lead to further broadening of the neutron spectrum, leading to erroneous inference of ion temperature. Motion of the reacting plasma will affect DD and DT neutrons differently, leading to disagreement between ion temperatures inferred from the two reactions. This effect may be a contributor to observations over the past decades of ion temperatures higher than expected from simulations, ion temperatures in disagreement with observed yields, and different temperatures measured in the same implosion from DD and DT neutrons. This difference in broadening of DD and DT neutrons also provides a measure of turbulent motion in a fusion plasma. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic instabilities are a major factor in degradation of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions. In the highest performing implosions on National Ignition Facility, yield amplification (YA) due to alpha particle heating approached ∼3, while YA of ∼15-30 is needed for ignition. Understanding and mitigation of the instabilities are critical to achieving ignition. This article reviews several experimental platforms that have been developed to directly measure these instabilities in all phases of ICF implosions. Measurements of ripple-shock propagation at OMEGA laser has provided results on initial seeds for the instabilities in three ablators - plastic (CH), beryllium, and high-density carbon. At the ablation front, instability growth of pre-imposed modulations was measured in the linear regime using the hydrodynamic growth radiography platform. This platform was extended for modulation growth of 'native roughness' modulations and engineering features (fill tubes and capsule support membranes or 'tents'). Several new experimental platforms have or are being developed to measure instability growth at the ablator-ice interface. In the deceleration phase of implosions, complementary 'self-emission' and 'self-backlighting' platforms were developed to measure low-mode asymmetries and high-mode perturbations near peak compression.},

abstract = {In the last five years, large amounts of high quality data on inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments were produced at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). From this data we have significantly advanced our scientific understanding of the physics of thermonuclear (TN) ignition and identified critical issues that must be addressed to achieve a burning hotspot, such as implosion energetics, pusher adiabat, tamping effects, and confinement time. In this paper we present a review of recently developed TN ignition and implosion scaling theory (Cheng et al 2013 Phys. Rev. E 88 041101; Cheng et al 2014 Phys. Plasmas 21 10270) that characterizes the thermodynamic properties of the hotspot and the ignition criteria for ICF. We compare our theoretical predictions with NIF data and find good agreement between theory and experiments. We demonstrate the fundamental effects of the pusher adiabat on the energy partition between the cold shell and the hot deuterium-tritium (DT) gas, and thus on the integrated performance of ICF capsules. Theoretical analysis of NIF experiments (Cheng et al 2015 Phys. Plasmas 22 082704; Melvin et al 2015 Phys. Plasmas 22 022708; Cheng et al 2016 Phys. Plasmas 23 120702) and physical explanations of the discrepancies between theory, data, and simulations are presented. It is shown that the true experimental adiabat of the cold DT fuel can be inferred from neutron image data of a capsule implosion. We show that the ablator mix and preheat in the cold fuel can be estimated from the experimentally inferred hotspot mix. Finally, possible paths forward to reach higher yields at NIF implied by the theory are discussed.},

@article{Rothenberg2000,
abstract = {For both direct and indirect drive approaches to inertial confinement fusion (ICF) it is imperative to obtain the best possible drive beam uniformity. The approach chosen for the National Ignition Facility uses a random-phase plate to generate a speckle pattern with a precisely controlled envelope on target. A number of temporal smoothing techniques can then be employed to utilize bandwidth to rapidly change the speckle pattern, and thus average out the small-scale speckle structure. One technique which generally can supplement other smoothing methods is polarization smoothing (PS): the illumination of the target with two distinct and orthogonally polarized speckle patterns. Since these two polarizations do not interfere, the intensity patterns add incoherently, and the rms nonuniformity can be reduced by a factor of √2. A number of PS schemes are described and compared on the basis of the aggregate rms and the spatial spectrum of the focused illumination distribution. The √2 rms nonuniformity reduction of PS is present on an instantaneous basis and is, therefore, of particular interest for the suppression of laser plasma instabilities, which have a very rapid response time. When combining PS and temporal methods, such as smoothing by spectral dispersion (SSD), PS can reduce the rms of the temporally smoothed illumination by an additional factor of √2. However, it has generally been thought that in order to achieve this reduction of √2, the increased divergence of the beam from PS must exceed the divergence of SSD. It is also shown here that, over the time scales of interest to direct or indirect drive ICF, under some conditions PS can reduce the smoothed illumination rms by nearly √2 even when the PS divergence is much smaller than that of SSD. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

Two ion kinetic mechanisms are used to explain the anomalous observations: thermal decoupling of the D and He3 populations and diffusive species separation. The observed insensitivity of ion temperature to a varying deuterium fraction is shown to be a signature of ion thermal decoupling in shock-heated plasmas. The burn-averaged deuterium fraction calculated from the experimental data demonstrates a reduction in the average core deuterium density, as predicted by simulations that use a diffusion model. Accounting for each of these effects in simulations reproduces the observed yield trends.},

A short series of experiments designed specifically to avoid these degradations to the implosion are described here in order to understand if, once they are removed, a high-convergence cryogenic-layered deuterium-tritium implosion can achieve the 1D simulated performance. The result is a cryogenic layered implosion, round at stagnation, that matches closely the performance predicted by 1D simulations.

A replaceable assembly of nozzles with heaters and thermometers is designed to be implemented in the target chamber of the OMEGA laser. Targets are held between the nozzles by spider webs which are attached to an independently positioned fixture.

abstract = {The shock-wave propagation characteristics of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), fused silica, and sapphire were measured for both compressive and rarefaction waves using plate-impact experiments and interferometer instrumentation techniques. The peak stress levels in the experiments were 22, 65, and 120 kbar, respectively. The high-resolution measurements of the stress wave profiles showed the PMMA to be a complex material whose wave propagation is influenced by nonlinearity, strain-rate dependence, and elastic-plastic effects in which plastic working increases the zero-pressure volume of the material. The fused silica is very well characterized as a nonlinear elastic material having the interesting property of propagating stable rarefaction shock waves. The sapphire was nearly linear elastic to 120 kbar. The use of these three transparent materials as "windows" in laser interferometer instrumented shock-wave studies of other materials is discussed. The effect of the shock-induced variation of the index of refraction on the interferometer data was also measured and is presented. {\textcopyright} 1970 The American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Transport modeling of idealized, cone-guided fast ignition targets indicates the severe challenge posed by fast-electron source divergence. The hybrid particle-in-cell (PIC) code Zuma is run in tandem with the radiation-hydrodynamics code Hydra to model fast-electron propagation, fuel heating, and thermonuclear burn. The fast electron source is based on a 3D explicit-PIC laser-plasma simulation with the PSC code. This shows a quasi two-temperature energy spectrum and a divergent angle spectrum (average velocity-space polar angle of 52°). Transport simulations with the PIC-based divergence do not ignite for {\textgreater}1 MJ of fast-electron energy, for a modest (70 $\mu$ m) standoff distance from fast-electron injection to the dense fuel. However, artificially collimating the source gives an ignition energy of 132 kJ. To mitigate the divergence, we consider imposed axial magnetic fields. Uniform fields ∼50 MG are sufficient to recover the artificially collimated ignition energy. Experiments at the Omega laser facility have generated fields of this magnitude by imploding a capsule in seed fields of 50-100 kG. Such imploded fields will likely be more compressed in the transport region than in the laser absorption region. When fast electrons encounter increasing field strength, magnetic mirroring can reflect a substantial fraction of them and reduce coupling to the fuel. A hollow magnetic pipe, which peaks at a finite radius, is presented as one field configuration which circumvents mirroring. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We present an experimental result of significantly increased heating in a laser-driven blastwave experiment carried out at the OMEGA laser facility. Abnormally high temperatures were observed in warm dense CH compared to older experiments and theoretical predictions. The higher temperatures in compressed CH were linked to an improved smoothness of the laser intensity profile, which resulted in better efficiency of the drive and coupling of more energy into the system compared to previous similar experiments. Fifteen beams with combined intensity of ∼7 1014 W cm-2 and a square intensity profile with 2 ns duration were used to drive a strong shock, which subsequently developed to a blastwave travelling through low density CH foam creating warm dense matter. Multiple diagnostics were used to examine the thermodynamic conditions in the warm dense CH foam. Velocity interferometry (VISAR) and streaked pyrometry (SOP) observed increased blastwave velocities, while x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measured elevated temperatures of 17.5 - 35 eV in compressed CH foam. The experimental results were compared to hydrodynamic simulations and a potential contribution from x-rays to the elevated temperatures in the dense material was considered.},

L. Kruer, Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 2, 51 (1975)] simulations are performed to create a database of barely ignited capsules that span the parameter regime of interest. This database is used to develop scaling laws for the ignition energy in terms of both the stagnated capsule parameters and the in-flight capsule parameters, and to explore the connection between these two parameter sets. We then examine how much extra energy is required to overcome the effect of the inevitable surface imperfections that are amplified during the implosion process. These perturbations can lead to break up of the capsule in flight or to mix of cold fuel into the hot spot, both of which can cause the capsule to fail. As an example, a family of capsules with fixed adiabat, drive pressure, and absorbed energy is studied; the capsule from this family that is maximally robust to these failure modes is found. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Abu-Shawareb2022,
abstract = {For more than half a century, researchers around the world have been engaged in attempts to achieve fusion ignition as a proof of principle of various fusion concepts. Following the Lawson criterion, an ignited plasma is one where the fusion heating power is high enough to overcome all the physical processes that cool the fusion plasma, creating a positive thermodynamic feedback loop with rapidly increasing temperature. In inertially confined fusion, ignition is a state where the fusion plasma can begin "burn propagation" into surrounding cold fuel, enabling the possibility of high energy gain. While "scientific breakeven" (i.e., unity target gain) has not yet been achieved (here target gain is 0.72, 1.37 MJ of fusion for 1.92 MJ of laser energy), this Letter reports the first controlled fusion experiment, using laser indirect drive, on the National Ignition Facility to produce capsule gain (here 5.8) and reach ignition by nine different formulations of the Lawson criterion. Nuclear fusion reactions combine two light nuclei into a heavier one, releasing substantial energy in the process. Approaches to generating energy production from fusion typically use thermal reactions (where electron temperature T e and ion temperature T i are similar); in order for copious reactions to occur the fuel must be at extremely high ion temperatures, on the order of several kilo-electron-volts (where 1 keV ¼ 1.16 × 10 7 K). The fundamental challenge of fusion is that while the fusion reactions can self-heat the plasma, at these temperatures the plasma also rapidly loses energy via cooling mechanisms, such as the x-ray radiation that is emitted by the bremsstrahlung process. Early researchers recognized that the most favored fusion reaction is deuterium (D)-tritium (T) fusion [D þ T → nð14.1 MeVÞ þ 4 Heð3.5 MeVÞ] [1] because it has the lowest temperature, ≈4.3 keV, at which fusion self-heating power just balances losses from bremsstrahlung x-ray radiation. Additional energy loss mechanisms, such as heat conduction, also cool the plasma, requiring higher temperatures than 4.3 keV to achieve "ignition," which is when the self-heating overpowers all loss mechanisms ("Lawson-like" ignition criteria) [2] and the temperature rises through a positive thermodynamic instability, resulting in an increasing fusion burn. Such conditions occur in nature in novae and type-1a supernovae, or terrestrially in thermonuclear weapon explosions. Ignition is a step beyond a "burning plasma," where self-heating exceeds the external energy input to heat the plasma as had been recently achieved [3,4]. This Letter reports on the culmination of a decade effort in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [5] that resulted in an igniting implosion with over a megajoule fusion yield putting ICF on the threshold of unity gain in the laboratory for the first time. This is the first controlled fusion experiment to exceed Lawson-like ignition statements. Ignition is required for net gain and energy applications using the ICF approach; in contrast, ignition may not be required for other approaches to fusion such as magnetic confinement experiments like the ITER experiment [6]. The original idea behind ICF was explored using lasers to focus energy onto a small capsule containing DT fuel and isentropically compress the target to obtain high thermal temperature (T th ≈ T e ≈ T i) and pressures [7,8] (see Ref. [9] for the early history). Here, the fusion burn proceeds while contained by the inertia of the fuel itself over a brief period of time. The inertial confinement time ($\tau$) is related to the "areal density" [$\rho$R as the radial integral of density, $\rho$ðRÞ] of the fuel. Ignition and subsequent burn into the surrounding fuel (burn propagation) initiates an explosive, but microscopic scale, release of energy. Instead of directly driving a capsule with lasers, as originally proposed, here we use "indirect drive." The indirect-drive approach to ICF [10] drives a high atomic number cavity, a hohlraum [see Fig. 1(a)], with laser energy, thereby generating a bath of intense x rays, measured in terms of radiation temperature [T rad ∼ 300 eV, see Fig. 1(b)]. The capsule placed at the center of the hohlraum [see Fig. 1(a)] and its outer surface, the ablator, absorbs the x-ray energy (roughly in proportion to the surface area ratio of the capsule to hohlraum) in a thin layer of ionized plasma, generating high ablation pressures (of order hundreds of megabars) which produces an inward acceleration (implosion) that accelerates the remaining ablator and DT fuel to high velocity. The generation of ablation pressure is accompanied *},

HELIOS-CR has been designed for ease of use, and is well-suited for experimentalists, as well as graduate and undergraduate student researchers. The energy equations employed include models for laser energy deposition, radiation from external sources, and high-current discharges. Radiative transport can be calculated using either a multi-frequency flux-limited diffusion model, or a multi-frequency, multi-angle short characteristics model. HELIOS-CR supports the use of SESAME equation of state (EOS) tables, PROPACEOS EOS/ multi-group opacity data tables, and non-LTE plasma properties computed using the inline CR modeling. Time-, space-, and frequency-dependent results from HELIOS-CR calculations are readily displayed with the HydroPLOT graphics tool. In addition, the results of HELIOS simulations can be post-processed using the SPECT3D Imaging and Spectral Analysis Suite to generate images and spectra that can be directly compared with experimental measurements.

We report the results of unique separated reactants implosion experiments studying pre-mixed contaminant as well as detailed high-resolution three-dimensional simulations that are in good agreement with experiments. At conditions relevant to mixing regions in high-yield implosions, we observe persistent chunks of contaminant that do not achieve thermal equilibrium with the fuel throughout the burn phase.

Improvements have been made to several of the physics packages, especially the atomic physics and opacity models. Recent additions and modifications have been made to allow more realistic simulations of materials at temperatures below a few eV. These include models for materials with strength, yield, and linear heat conduction. Examples of simulations of two recent laboratory experiments demonstrates the utility of the code. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {The quest for controlled fusion energy has been ongoing for over a half century. The demonstration of ignition and energy gain from thermonuclear fuels in the laboratory has been a major goal of fusion research for decades. Thermonuclear ignition is widely considered a milestone in the development of fusion energy, as well as a major scientific achievement with important applications in national security and basic sciences. The US is arguably the world leader in the inertial confinement approach to fusion and has invested in large facilities to pursue it, with the objective of establishing the science related to the safety and reliability of the stockpile of nuclear weapons. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, major challenges still remain in the quest for thermonuclear ignition via laser fusion. Here, we review the current state of the art in inertial confinement fusion research and describe the underlying physical principles.},

abstract = {The Titania laser system, based around a 42 cm e-beam pumped KrF amplifier, is currently being installed at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and will come on line as a user facility in 1996. Like Sprite, its predecessor, it will operate in both CPA (249 nm) and Raman (268 nm) short-pulse modes, delivering up to 10 TW to target in high-quality beams. With brightness expected to reach 1021 W cm−2 sterad−1, it will be the world's brightest ultraviolet laser. The design of the Titania system includes a number of novel features. The multi-pass Ti:sapphire front-end amplifier uses an unusual beam-folding scheme. The Raman system will involve the first application of Raman multiplexing, combining high KrF efficiency with low transport cost. Reflective coatings with very high damage thresholds are being developed for the CPA compressor gratings and the UV transport optics. A windowless configuration for the final Raman amplifier is presently under analysis, to allow the performance of this maximally stressed component to be extended substantially. Finally the design of the Titania e-beam machine, featuring novel split-cathode diodes, has resulted in unusually high efficiency of electron transport into the laser gas. The laser's infrastructure has involved sophisticated mechanical and electrical design, and a computerized diagnostic, control and safety package is being developed to allow one-man operation of the whole 1000 m2 installation. {\textcopyright} 1996 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Silica aerogel is an important low-density pressure standard used in many high energy density experiments, including the novel technique of shock and release. Due to its many applications, it has been a heavily studied material and has a well-known Hugoniot curve. This work then complements the velocity and pressure measurements with additional temperature data providing the full EOS information within the warm dense matter regime for the temperature interval of 1-15 eV and shock velocities between 10 and 40 km/s corresponding to shock pressures of 0.3-2 Mbar. The experimental results were compared with hydrodynamic simulations and EOS models. We found that the measured temperature was systematically lower than suggested by theoretical calculations. Simulations provide a possible explanation that the emission measured by optical pyrometry comes from a radiative precursor rather than from the shock front, which could have important implications for such measurements.},

Recent work [Keenan et al., Phys. Rev. E 96, 053203 (2017)] answered in detail a number of outstanding questions concerning the kinetic structure of steady-state, planar plasma shocks, e.g., the shock width scaling by the Mach number, M. However, it did not discuss shock-driven ion-species stratification (e.g., relative concentration modification and temperature separation). These are important effects since many recent ICF experiments have evaded explanation by standard, single-fluid, radiation-hydrodynamic (rad-hydro) numerical simulations, and shock-driven fuel stratification likely contributes to this discrepancy. Employing the state-of-the-art Vlasov-Fokker-Planck code, iFP, along with multi-ion hydro simulations and semi-analytics, we quantify the ion stratification by planar shocks with the arbitrary Mach number and the relative species concentration for two-ion plasmas in terms of ion mass and charge ratios. In particular, for strong shocks, we find that the structure of the ion temperature separation has a nearly universal character across ion mass and charge ratios. Additionally, we find that the shock fronts are enriched with the lighter ion species and the enrichment scales as M4 for M ≪ 1.},

abstract = {A new fusion capsule drive scheme was investigated. The capsule is illuminated by a low intensity thermal X ray pulse prior to the main drive pulse. This leads to a noticeable suppression of initial imprinting by the drive beam because of thermal smoothing in the preformed plasma. Of the several types of indirect-direct hybrid target, the authors investigated the hybrid effect for two types. One is a foam hybrid, in which the fuel capsule has a low density foam layer attached directly on its surface and where pulsed radiation generated from a thin high Z layer on the foam propagates through the foam, creating a preformed plasma. The other is an external hybrid, in which the capsule is illuminated by external X ray radiation generated using different beams from the capsule drive beams. The hybrid effect was demonstrated for both types by imposing an initial imprint on a planar target with an intensity modulated beam, and subsequent non-uniformity growth due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability was observed by means of face-on backlighting. The observed suppression due to the presence of the preformed plasma is interpreted by a cloudy day model for both hybrids. Capsule implosion experiments have also been started. The overall implosion dynamics observed is replicated by 1-D hydrocode simulations. Preliminary results from the implosion experiments are presented.},

FLASH has been successful because its capabilities have been driven by the needs of scientific applications, without compromising maintainability, performance, and usability. In its newest incarnation, FLASH3 consists of inter-operable modules that can be combined to generate different applications. The FLASH architecture allows arbitrarily many alternative implementations of its components to co-exist and interchange with each other, resulting in greater flexibility. Further, a simple and elegant mechanism exists for customization of code functionality without the need to modify the core implementation of the source. A built-in unit test framework providing verifiability, combined with a rigorous software maintenance process, allow the code to operate simultaneously in the dual mode of production and development. In this paper we describe the FLASH3 architecture, with emphasis on solutions to the more challenging conflicts arising from solver complexity, portable performance requirements, and legacy codes. We also include results from user surveys conducted in 2005 and 2007, which highlight the success of the code. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

A marginal ignition curve is derived in the $\rho$ Rtot, Tih plane and current implosion experiments are compared with the ignition curve. On this plane, hydrodynamic equivalent curves show how a given implosion would perform with respect to the ignition condition when scaled up in the laser-driver energy.

Forty OMEGA beams arranged in six rings to emulate the NIF x-ray-drive configuration are used to perform direct-drive implosions of CH shells filled with D2 gas. Target performance was diagnosed with framed x-ray backlighting and by the measured fusion yield. Saturn target experiments have resulted in ∼75{\%} of the yield from energy-equivalent, symmetrically irradiated implosions. The results of the two-dimensional PDD simulations performed with DRACO are in good agreement with experimental x-ray radiographs. DRACO is being used to further optimize standard PDD designs.

abstract = {Indirect drive inertial confinement fusion experiments with convergence ratios below 17 have been previously shown to be less susceptible to Rayleigh–Taylor hydrodynamic instabilities, making this regime highly interesting for fusion science. Additional limitations imposed on the implosion velocity, in-flight aspect ratio and applied laser power aim to further reduce instability growth, resulting in a new regime where performance can be well represented by one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic simulations. A simulation campaign was performed using the 1D radiation-hydrodynamics code HYADES to investigate the performance that could be achieved using direct-drive implosions of liquid layer capsules, over a range of relevant energies. Results include potential gains of 0.19 on LMJ-scale systems and 0.75 on NIF-scale systems, and a reactor-level gain of 54 for an 8.5 MJ implosion. While the use of 1D simulations limits the accuracy of these results, they indicate a sufficiently high level of performance to warrant further investigations and verification of this new low-instability regime. This potentially suggests an attractive new approach to fusion energy.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Prospects for high gain inertial fusion energy (part 2)'.},

abstract = {A comprehensive model is developed to study alpha-heating in inertially confined plasmas. It describes the time evolution of a central low-density hot spot confined by a compressible shell, heated by fusion alphas, and cooled by radiation and thermal losses. The model includes the deceleration, stagnation, and burn phases of inertial confinement fusion implosions, and is valid for sub-ignited targets with ≤10× amplification of the fusion yield from alpha-heating. The results of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations are used to derive realistic initial conditions and dimensionless parameters for the model. It is found that most of the alpha energy (∼90{\%}) produced before bang time is deposited within the hot spot mass, while a small fraction (∼10{\%}) drives mass ablation off the inner shell surface and its energy is recycled back into the hot spot. Of the bremsstrahlung radiation emission, ∼40{\%} is deposited in the hot spot, ∼40{\%} is recycled back in the hot spot by ablation off the shell, and ∼20{\%} leaves the hot spot. We show here that the hot spot, shocked shell, and outer shell trajectories from this analytical model are in good agreement with simulations. A detailed discussion of the effect of alpha-heating on the hydrodynamics is also presented.},

abstract = {A streaked pyrometer has been designed to measure the temperature of ≈100 $\mu$m diameter heated targets in the warm dense matter region. The diagnostic has picosecond time resolution. Spatial resolution is limited by the streak camera to 4 $\mu$m in one dimension; the imaging system has superior resolution of 1 $\mu$m. High light collection efficiency means that the diagnostic can transmit a measurable quantity of thermal emission at temperatures as low as 1 eV to the detector. This is achieved through the use of an f/1.4 objective, and a minimum number of reflecting and refracting surfaces to relay the image over 8 m with no vignetting over a 0.4 mm field of view with 12.5× magnification. All the system optics are highly corrected, to allow imaging with minimal aberrations over a broad spectral range. The detector is a highly sensitive Axis Photonique streak camera with a P820PSU streak tube. For the first time, two of these cameras have been absolutely calibrated at 1 ns and 2 ns sweep speeds under full operational conditions and over 8 spectral bands between 425 nm and 650 nm using a high-stability picosecond white light source. Over this range the cameras had a response which varied between 47 ± 8 and 14 ± 4 photons/count. The calibration of the optical imaging system makes absolute temperature measurements possible. Color temperature measurements are also possible due to the wide spectral range over which the system is calibrated; two different spectral bands can be imaged onto different parts of the photocathode of the same streak camera.},

Second harmonic emission was filtered out and the target viewed at an angle to eliminate optical transition radiation. Spatial resolution was obtained by imaging the emission onto a bundle of fibre optics, arranged into a one-dimensional array at the camera entrance. The results show that a region 160 $\mu$m in diameter can be heated to a temperature of ∼107 K (kT/e ∼ keV) in solid targets from 10 to 20 $\mu$m thick and that this temperature is maintained for at least 20 ps, confirming the utility of PW lasers in the study of high energy density physics. Hybrid code modelling shows that magnetic field generation prevents increased target heating by electron refluxing above a certain target thickness and that the absorption of laser energy into electrons entering the solid target was between 15-30{\%}, and tends to increase with laser energy. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

@article{Craxton2015,
abstract = {The direct-drive, laser-based approach to inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is reviewed from its inception following the demonstration of the first laser to its implementation on the present generation of high-power lasers. The review focuses on the evolution of scientific understanding gained from target-physics experiments in many areas, identifying problems that were demonstrated and the solutions implemented. The review starts with the basic understanding of laser-plasma interactions that was obtained before the declassification of laser-induced compression in the early 1970s and continues with the compression experiments using infrared lasers in the late 1970s that produced thermonuclear neutrons. The problem of suprathermal electrons and the target preheat that they caused, associated with the infrared laser wavelength, led to lasers being built after 1980 to operate at shorter wavelengths, especially 0.35 $\mu$m - the third harmonic of the Nd:glass laser - and 0.248 $\mu$m (the KrF gas laser). The main physics areas relevant to direct drive are reviewed. The primary absorption mechanism at short wavelengths is classical inverse bremsstrahlung. Nonuniformities imprinted on the target by laser irradiation have been addressed by the development of a number of beam-smoothing techniques and imprint-mitigation strategies. The effects of hydrodynamic instabilities are mitigated by a combination of imprint reduction and target designs that minimize the instability growth rates. Several coronal plasma physics processes are reviewed. The two-plasmon-decay instability, stimulated Brillouin scattering (together with cross-beam energy transfer), and (possibly) stimulated Raman scattering are identified as potential concerns, placing constraints on the laser intensities used in target designs, while other processes (self-focusing and filamentation, the parametric decay instability, and magnetic fields), once considered important, are now of lesser concern for mainline direct-drive target concepts. Filamentation is largely suppressed by beam smoothing. Thermal transport modeling, important to the interpretation of experiments and to target design, has been found to be nonlocal in nature. Advances in shock timing and equation-of-state measurements relevant to direct-drive ICF are reported. Room-temperature implosions have provided an increased understanding of the importance of stability and uniformity. The evolution of cryogenic implosion capabilities, leading to an extensive series carried out on the 60-beam OMEGA laser [Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)], is reviewed together with major advances in cryogenic target formation. A polar-drive concept has been developed that will enable direct-drive-ignition experiments to be performed on the National Ignition Facility [Haynam et al., Appl. Opt. 46(16), 3276 (2007)]. The advantages offered by the alternative approaches of fast ignition and shock ignition and the issues associated with these concepts are described. The lessons learned from target-physics and implosion experiments are taken into account in ignition and high-gain target designs for laser wavelengths of 1/3 $\mu$m and 1/4 $\mu$m. Substantial advances in direct-drive inertial fusion reactor concepts are reviewed. Overall, the progress in scientific understanding over the past five decades has been enormous, to the point that inertial fusion energy using direct drive shows significant promise as a future environmentally attractive energy source.},

abstract = {High-energy-density physics is the field of physics concerned with studying matter at extremely high temperatures and densities. Such conditions produce highly nonlinear plasmas, in which several phenomena that can normally be treated independently of one another become strongly coupled. The study of these plasmas is important for our understanding of astrophysics, nuclear fusion and fundamental physics—however, the nonlinearities and strong couplings present in these extreme physical systems makes them very difficult to understand theoretically or to optimize experimentally. Here we argue that machine learning models and data-driven methods are in the process of reshaping our exploration of these extreme systems that have hitherto proved far too nonlinear for human researchers. From a fundamental perspective, our understanding can be improved by the way in which machine learning models can rapidly discover complex interactions in large datasets. From a practical point of view, the newest generation of extreme physics facilities can perform experiments multiple times a second (as opposed to approximately daily), thus moving away from human-based control towards automatic control based on real-time interpretation of diagnostic data and updates of the physics model. To make the most of these emerging opportunities, we suggest proposals for the community in terms of research design, training, best practice and support for synthetic diagnostics and data analysis.},

Distinctions are made between what must be determined numerically and what can be derived algebraically. New solutions are described which contain additional converging shocks, arriving at the origin concurrently with the initial shock or free surface. Some of these new solutions are entirely analytic, except at the shocks themselves, and some are not; in some cases, only one secondary shock is possible, in other cases an arbitrary number. The physical significance of previously rejected partial solutions is discussed. The stability of solutions is discussed in a narrow (one-dimensional) sense. Finally, a study is urged of the asymptotic approach (or nonapproach) to self-similarity of direct numerical integrations of the original partial differential equations; it is argued that the evidence for approach to a unique self-similar solution is not convincing.},

abstract = {Polymers and foams are pervasive in everyday life, as well as in specialized contexts such as space exploration, industry, and defense. They are frequently subject to shock loading in the latter cases, and will chemically decompose to small molecule gases and carbon (soot) under loads of sufficient strength. We review a body of work-most of it performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory-on polymers and foams under extreme conditions. To provide some context, we begin with a brief review of basic concepts in shockwave physics, including features particular to transitions (chemical reaction or phase transition) entailing an abrupt reduction in volume. We then discuss chemical formulations and synthesis, as well as experimental platforms used to interrogate polymers under shock loading. A high-level summary of equations of state for polymers and their decomposition products is provided, and their application illustrated. We then present results including temperatures and product compositions, thresholds for reaction, wave profiles, and some peculiarities of traditional modeling approaches. We close with some thoughts regarding future work.},

abstract = {The physical and chemical properties of materials are profoundly affected by high pressure and temperature and differ significantly from the behavior commonly observed at ambient conditions. Understanding the interior dynamics and evolution of planetary bodies thus requires measurement of the equations of state of materials at these extreme conditions. Experiments employing laser-driven shock compression now permit exploration of phase space spanning orders of magnitude in pressure and temperature. Results are presented here from a suite of laser-driven shock experiments on three major mineral phases of significance to the terrestrial mantle: SiO2, MgO and MgSiO3. New optical diagnostics, including an absolutely calibrated streaked optical pyrometry system were developed to measure shock temperatures from {\~{}} 4000-60,000 K. This system was applied to observe high-pressure phase transitions and melting at previously unexplored conditions. Experiments on two polymorphs of SiO2 are used to validate experimental technique and pyrometry calibration and are compared to previous results. Data on MgO and MgSiO3 constrain controversial predications for the ultra-high pressure melt curves and support melting temperatures at the Earth's core-mantle boundary higher than most previous predictions. In the case of MgSiO3, the first observations of a distinct liquid- liquid phase transformation in a silicate material are presented. Experiments on amorphous and crystalline MgSiO3 starting materials show evidence of a transition to a high-pressure liquid phase approximately 10{\%} denser than the low-pressure counterpart. Isochemical liquid-liquid phase separation may represent a previously unrecognized means of geochemical partitioning in early planetary history. Finally, discussions of the transport properties of each material are given and it is found that all three transform to metallic liquids upon melting with high thermal and electrical conductivity, suggesting the possibility of enhanced electromagnetic coupling across the core-mantle boundary in the molten state. 1},

abstract = {Experiments in high-energy-density physics often use optical pyrometry to determine temperatures of dynamically compressed materials. In combination with simultaneous shock-velocity and optical-reflectivity measurements using velocity interferometry, these experiments provide accurate equation-of-state data at extreme pressures (P {\textgreater} 1 Mbar) and temperatures (T {\textgreater} 0.5 eV). This paper reports on the absolute calibration of the streaked optical pyrometer (SOP) at the Omega Laser Facility. The wavelength-dependent system response was determined by measuring the optical emission from a National Institute of Standards and Technology-traceable tungsten-filament lamp through various narrowband (40-nm-wide) filters. The integrated signal over the SOP's ∼250-nm operating range is then related to that of a blackbody radiator using the calibrated response. We present a simple closed-form equation for the brightness temperature as a function of streak-camera signal derived from this calibration. Error estimates indicate that brightness temperature can be inferred to a precision of {\textless}5{\%}.},

Previous ICF experiments at the NIF utilized high convergence (CR{\textgreater}30) DT ice layer implosions. Although high CR is desirable in an idealized 1D sense, it amplifies the deleterious effects of asymmetries. To date, these asymmetries prevented the achievement of ignition at the NIF and are the major cause of simulation-experiment disagreement. In the initial liquid layer experiments, high neutron yields were achieved with CRs of 12-17, and the hot-spot formation is well understood, demonstrated by a good agreement between the experimental data and the radiation hydrodynamic simulations. These initial experiments open a new NIF experimental capability that provides an opportunity to explore the relationship between hot-spot convergence ratio and the robustness of hot-spot formation during ICF implosions.},

This most often involves building a model relationship between a dependent, measurable output, and an associated set of controllable, but complicated, independent inputs. We present a tutorial on current techniques in machine learning - a jumping-off point for interested researchers to advance their work. We focus on deep neural networks with an emphasis on demystifying deep learning. We begin with background ideas in machine learning and some example applications from current research in plasma physics. We discuss supervised learning techniques for modeling complicated functions, beginning with familiar regression schemes, and then advancing to more sophisticated deep learning methods. We also address unsupervised learning and techniques for reducing the dimensionality of input spaces. Along the way, we describe methods for practitioners to help ensure that their models generalize from their training data to as-yet-unseen test data. We describe classes of tasks - predicting scalars, handling images, and fitting time-series - and prepare the reader to choose an appropriate technique. We finally point out some limitations to modern machine learning and speculate on some ways that practitioners from the physical sciences may be particularly suited to help.},

@article{Davis2016,
abstract = {The angularly resolved mass ablation rates and ablation-front trajectories for Si-coated CH targets were measured in direct-drive inertial confinement fusion experiments to quantify cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) while constraining the hydrodynamic coupling. A polar-direct-drive laser configuration, where the equatorial laser beams were dropped and the polar beams were repointed from a symmetric direct-drive configuration, was used to limit CBET at the pole while allowing it to persist at the equator. The combination of low- and high-CBET conditions observed in the same implosion allowed for the effects of CBET on the ablation rate and ablation pressure to be determined. Hydrodynamic simulations performed without CBET agreed with the measured ablation rate and ablation-front trajectory at the pole of the target, confirming that the CBET effects on the pole are small. The simulated mass ablation rates and ablation-front trajectories were in excellent agreement with the measurements at all angles when a CBET model based on Randall's equations [C. J. Randall et al., Phys. Fluids 24, 1474 (1981)] was included into the simulations with a multiplier on the CBET gain factor. These measurements were performed on OMEGA and at the National Ignition Facility to access a wide range of plasma conditions, laser intensities, and laser beam geometries. The presence of the CBET gain multiplier required to match the data in all of the configurations tested suggests that additional physics effects, such as intensity variations caused by diffraction, polarization effects, or shortcomings of extending the 1-D Randall model to 3-D, should be explored to explain the differences in observed and predicted drive.},

abstract = {Polystyrene (CH) is often chosen as the ablator material for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets. Its static, dynamical, and optical properties in warm, dense conditions (due to shock compression) are important for ICF designs. Using the first-principles quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) method, we have investigated the equation of state (EOS) and optical reflectivity of shock-compressed CH up to an unprecedentedly high pressure of 62 Mbar along the principal Hugoniot. The QMD results are compared with existing experimental measurements as well as the SESAME EOS model. Although the Hugoniot pressure and/or temperature from QMD calculations agrees with experiments and the SESAME EOS model at low pressures below 10 Mbar, we have identified for the first time a stiffer behavior of shocked CH at higher pressures ({\textgreater}10 Mbar). Such a stiffer behavior of warm, dense CH can affect the ablation pressure (shock strength), shock coalescence dynamics, and nonuniformity growth in ICF implosions. In addition, we corrected the mistake made in literature for calculating the reflectivity of shocked CH and obtained good agreements with experimental measurements, which should lend credence to future opacity calculations in a first-principles fashion. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The main objective of the work is to study the conversion of the laser pulse energy into the energy of the hydrodynamic motion of matter in a solid target following the initial absorption of laser radiation in a layer of porous material. Results of experiments on plane massive aluminum targets, coated with a layer of porous plastic with density greater than the critical density of the plasma created, are presented. Experiments were carried out on the laser installation ABC of the Research Center ENEA-Frascati; the targets were irradiated by a beam of the fundamental harmonic of Nd-laser radiation with an energy of about 50 kJ, intensity of 1013W/cm2, and 3 ns duration. The experimental method consisted in measuring the volume of the craters created on the aluminum surface behind various thicknesses and densities of the porous absorber of laser radiation. On the basis of these measurements and of an advanced analytical model, quantitative conclusions are made on how the efficiency of laser energy transfer to the solid part of the target (laser-ablated loading) depends on thickness and density of the porous absorber.},

abstract = {Particle accelerators have made an enormous impact in all fields of natural sciences, from elementary particle physics, to the imaging of proteins and the development of new pharmaceuticals. Modern light sources have advanced many fields by providing extraordinarily bright, short X-ray pulses. Here we present a novel numerical study, demonstrating that existing third generation light sources can significantly enhance the brightness and photon energy of their X-ray pulses by undulating their beams within plasma wakefields. This study shows that a three order of magnitude increase in X-ray brightness and over an order of magnitude increase in X-ray photon energy is achieved by passing a 3 GeV electron beam through a two-stage plasma insertion device. The production mechanism micro-bunches the electron beam and ensures the pulses are radially polarised on creation. We also demonstrate that the micro-bunched electron beam is itself an effective wakefield driver that can potentially accelerate a witness electron beam up to 6 GeV.},

However, the total amount of heavy elements that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune contain remains poorly constrained. The discovery of extrasolar giant planets with masses ranging from that of Saturn to a few times the mass of Jupiter opens up new possibilities for understanding planet composition and formation. Evolutionary models predict that gaseous extrasolar giant planets should have a variety of atmospheric temperatures and chemical compositions, but the radii are estimated to be close to that of Jupiter (between 0.9 and 1.7 Jupiter radii), provided that they contain mostly hydrogen and helium.},

Achieving ignition on NIF could be the catalyst for national and global leaders to support the development of inertial fusion energy (IFE) to meet the future's worldwide electric power demand. With sustained, high-priority funding could practical IFE be possible by the 2020 timeframe? The answer lies in how well can the community address and solve technical challenges in four key areas: achieving ignition, producing advanced targets and drivers, creating a practical fusion engine, and developing economical fusion power plants. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Increases in computational and modelling capabilities, as well as algorithmic developments have led to enhancement in our ability to perform multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of LPI at relevant scales. We discuss the physics of the interaction in terms of laser absorption fraction, the laser-generated electron spectra, divergence, and their temporal evolution. Scaling with irradiation conditions such as laser intensity are considered, as well as the dependence on plasma parameters. Different numerical modelling approaches and configurations are addressed, providing an overview of the modelling capabilities and limitations. In addition, we discuss the comparison of simulation results with experimental observables. In particular, we address the question of surrogacy of today's experiments for the full-scale FI problem. {\textcopyright} 2014 IAEA, Vienna.},

Because of the zero contact angle between the .D2 liquid and glass substrate and the limited wetting surface that is continuous, the liquid hydrogen completely covers the interior of the glass shell, resulting in the formation of a void at the center. For this reason, the present problem distinguishes itself from that for a sessile drop sitting on a flat surface. A theory was formulated to calculate the liquid hydrogen configuration by including the London-dispersion force between the liquid and the substrate molecules. The net result is an augmented Bashforth-Adams equation appropriate to a spherical substrate, which is considered to be the major contribution of the present work. Preliminary calculations indicate that this equation accurately models the liquid hydrogen behavior inside a spherical microshell.},

In this state, pressure and density are lower than the values predicted by Hugoniot relations for a uniform fluid with the same average fluid-foam density. It is shown that this undercompression phenomenon is due to residual correlations of fluctuations left after the saturation of the initially rapid mixing of fiber material with the background fluid. Generalized Hugoniot relations are derived for quasiplanar shocks in nonuniform systems, with foam as an example. The behavior of fluctuations in such systems is studied. Formulas for the level of fluctuations induced by a shock as it propagates through foam and for the relaxation time of the fluctuations, are derived. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

Nonlinear interactions of multiple beams in plasmas have the potential to produce optics that operate at much higher intensity and fluence than is possible in solids. In inertial confinement fusion experiments indirectly driven with lasers, many beams overlap in the plasma inside a hohlraum, and cross-beam energy transfer by Brillouin scattering has been employed to redistribute energy between laser beams within the target. Here, we show that in a hot, under-dense plasma the energy of many input beams can be combined into a single well-collimated beam. The emerging beam has an energy of 4 kJ (over 1 ns) that is more than triple that of any incident beam, and a fluence that is more than double. Because the optic produced is plasma, and is diffractive, it is inherently capable of generating higher fluences in a single beam than solid-state refractive or reflective optics.},

abstract = {Basic issues for the design of moderate-gain fast ignition targets at total laser energy of 200-400 kJ (with less than 100 kJ for the igniting beams) are discussed by means of a simple integrated gain model. Gain curves are generated and their sensitivity to several parameters is analyzed. A family of scaled target is designed, based on 1D hydrodynamic simulations of the implosion stage and 2D model simulations of ignition and burn. It is found that ignition and propagating burn can be achieved by targets compressed by 100-150 kJ, properly shaped laser pulses (with wavelength $\lambda$c =0.35 $\mu$m), and ignited by 80-100 kJ pulses. This requires adiabat shaped implosions to limit Rayleigh-Taylor instability, at the same time keeping the fuel entropy at a very low level. In addition, the igniting beam should be coupled to the fuel with an efficiency of about 25{\%}, and the hot-electron average penetration depth should be at most 1.2-1.5 g cm2. According to the present understanding of ultraintense laser-matter interaction, this limits the wavelength of the ignition beam to $\lambda$ig 0.5 $\mu$m. With the same assumptions, energy gain G=100 can be achieved by targets driven by a 250 kJ compression laser pulse and an 80-100 kJ ignition pulse. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

An analytical model is built to solve the laser collisional deposition fraction in the CH foam layer. The optimization of x-ray emission from under-critical CH foam coated gold targets by laser irradiation is obtained numerically with different CH foam densities and thicknesses. The plasma and x-ray emission properties are investigated. It is found that different CH thicknesses lead to different increase mechanisms for x-ray emission.

abstract = {A high-performance inertial confinement fusion capsule is compressed by multiple shock waves before it implodes. To minimize the entropy acquired by the fuel, the strength and timing of those shock waves must be accurately controlled. Ignition experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) will employ surrogate targets designed to mimic ignition targets while making it possible to measure the shock velocities inside the capsule. A series of experiments on the OMEGA laser facility [Boehly, Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] validated those targets and the diagnostic techniques proposed. Quartz was selected for the diagnostic window and shock-velocity measurements were demonstrated in Hohlraum targets heated to 180 eV. Cryogenic experiments using targets filled with liquid deuterium further demonstrated the entire timing technique in a Hohlraum environment. Direct-drive cryogenic targets with multiple spherical shocks were used to further validate this technique, including convergence effects at relevant pressures (velocities) and sizes. These results provide confidence that shock velocity and timing can be measured in NIF ignition targets, allowing these critical parameters to be optimized. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Fast ignition using pulsed-power drivers combines the efficient production of X-rays to drive fusion fuel assembly with precise ultraintense laser pulses for fuel ignition. Z-pinches convert electrical energy into thermal X-ray energy with high efficiency, which makes them attractive drivers for indirect-drive fuel assembly. Currently, experiments use the Z-pinch vacuum hohlraum, in which the Z-pinch heats a hohlraum that reemits thermal X-rays to drive the capsule. Surface-guided hemispherical capsule implosion experiments in Z-pinch vacuum hohlraums are in progress to study energetics, symmetry control, and pulse shaping. Simulations including radiation asymmetry and glide-plane physics have been performed to optimize the imploded fuel. Higher density capsule implosions at a given driver energy may be possible using the Z-pinch dynamic hohlraum, in which the Z-pinch plasma itself creates the hohlraum. Capsule and hohlraum designs for both vacuum and dynamic hohlraum sources are in progress, including liquid cryogenic fuel capsules. Analytic models for D-T fuel heating and burn have been developed for scoping purposes and break-even scaling. Implicit particle-in-cell modeling of the interaction of laser-produced energetic particles with calculated fuel configurations demonstrates that details of the entire fuel/glide material density profile significantly affect the calculated energy deposition and thus the ignition requirements.},

abstract = {High Density Carbon (or diamond) is a promising ablator material for use in near-vacuum hohlraums, as its high density allows for ignition designs with laser pulse durations of {\textless}10-ns. A series of Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) experiments in 2013 on the National Ignition Facility [Moses et al., Phys. Plasmas 16, 041006 (2009)] culminated in a deuterium-tritium (DT) layered implosion driven by a 6.8-ns, 2-shock laser pulse. This paper describes these experiments and comparisons with ICF design code simulations. Backlit radiography of a tritium-hydrogen-deuterium (THD) layered capsule demonstrated an ablator implosion velocity of 385-km/s with a slightly oblate hot spot shape. Other diagnostics suggested an asymmetric compressed fuel layer. A streak camera-based hot spot self-emission diagnostic (SPIDER) showed a double-peaked history of the capsule self-emission. Simulations suggest that this is a signature of low quality hot spot formation. Changes to the laser pulse and pointing for a subsequent DT implosion resulted in a higher temperature, prolate hot spot and a thermonuclear yield of 1.8-×-1015 neutrons, 40{\%} of the 1D simulated yield.},

In conclusion, a target can be highly compressed using multi-step laser pulse irradiation to a solid spherical target with an inserted gold cone. In an 8 kJ scale implosion, the maximum areal density of deuterium-tritium fuel reaches 0.39 g cm-2 according to 2D simulation results, which is 62{\%} of the case without the cone.

Laser light is able to propagate through the entrance hole for the required duration of the pulse. Gross hohlraum energetics mirror the results from an axisymmetric simulation.

Polarization smoothing (PS) with birefringent wedges and 1-THz-bandwidth smoothing by spectral dispersion (SSD) have been installed on OMEGA, The beam-to-beam power imbalance is ≤5{\%} rms. Implosions of 20-$\mu$m-thick CH shells (15 atm fill) using full beam smoothing (1-THz SSD and PS) have primary neutron yields and fuel areal densities that are ∼70{\%} larger than those driven with 0.35-THz SSD without PS. They also produce ∼35{\%} of the predicted one-dimensional neutron yield. The results described here suggest that individual-beam nonuniformity is no longer the primary cause of nonideal target performance.

The fractional burnup, bootstrap-heating, and depletion of the DT fuel, its expansive disassembly, and thermonuclear ignition by propagating burn from central hot spots in the microspheres are discussed. Extensive numerical results from a 3 T Lagrangian simulation code are presented. The yields Y0 from uniform 10,1, and 0.1 $\mu$g microspheres with densities $\rho$= 1 to 4 × 104 g/cm3 and temperatures Te = T1 = 1.8 to 100 keV are given. It is shown that Y0 ∼ $\rho$R, $\xi$R {\textless} 0.3 (R is the microsphere radius) or, equivalently, Y0 ∼ $\rho$2/3 for spheres of fixed mass m. The gain-factor G0 = Y0/mI0 (I0 is the internal energy) is shown to measure burn efficiency in uniform microspheres. More than a four-fold increment in the gain factor is shown to derive from apportionment of the internal energy in a central hot spot. The limiting effects of electron degeneracy on the gain factor are outlined. As a guideline, the experimental observation of 1013 neutrons/kJ of input laser energy is established as proof of good absorption; 1015 /kJ will imply yields exceeding break even.

abstract = {This article reviews a spectroscopic method for extracting plasma electron temperatures and electron energy distributions: trace rare gases optical emission spectroscopy. Specifically, traces of Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe are added to the plasma and the intensities of emissions from the Paschen 2p levels are recorded. Intensities are also computed from a model that includes direct excitation from the ground state, as well as two-step excitation through the 3P2, and 3P0 metastable levels. A Maxwellian electron energy distribution function (EEDF), described by an electron temperature (Te), is assumed, and Te is extracted from the best match between the observed and calculated relative emission intensities. By choosing emission from specific sets of levels, the range of electron energies effective in exciting emission can be selected and various portions of the EEDF can be investigated. Accurate measurement of T e depends critically on accurate cross sections for electron impact excitation, and hence a large portion of this article is devoted to a critical review of this subject. Improving on previous treatments, the model for computing emission intensities and electron temperatures includes a complete analysis of the complex excitation and de-excitation of the metastable levels. Previous measurements of Te and EEDFs in chlorine and oxygen inductively coupled plasmas are re-evaluated with the current model. In general, the current version of the model yields similar results; specific differences are discussed.},

Successful fielding of liquid-layer targets on NIF required not only a foam-lined capsule but also changes to the capsule filling process and the manner with which the inventory is maintained in the capsule. Additionally, changes to target heater power and the temperature drops across target components were required in order to achieve the desired range of shot temperatures.

@article{Lindl1995,
abstract = {Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is an approach to fusion that relies on the inertia of the fuel mass to provide confinement. To achieve conditions under which inertial confinement is sufficient for efficient thermonuclear burn, a capsule (generally a spherical shell) containing thermonuclear fuel is compressed in an implosion process to conditions of high density and temperature. ICF capsules rely on either electron conduction (direct drive) or x rays (indirect drive) for energy transport to drive an implosion. In direct drive, the laser beams (or charged particle beams) are aimed directly at a target. The laser energy is transferred to electrons by means of inverse bremsstrahlung or a variety of plasma collective processes. In indirect drive, the driver energy (from laser beams or ion beams) is first absorbed in a high-Z enclosure (a hohlraum), which surrounds the capsule. The material heated by the driver emits x rays, which drive the capsule implosion. For optimally designed targets, 70{\%}-80{\%} of the driver energy can be converted to x rays. The optimal hohlraum geometry depends on the driver. Because of relaxed requirements on laser beam uniformity, and reduced sensitivity to hydrodynamic instabilities, the U.S. ICF Program has concentrated most of its effort since 1976 on the x-ray or indirect-drive approach to ICF. As a result of years of experiments and modeling, we are building an increasingly strong case for achieving ignition by indirect drive on the proposed National Ignition Facility (NIF). The ignition target requirements for hohlraum energetics, radiation symmetry, hydrodynamic instabilities and mix, laser plasma interaction, pulse shaping, and ignition requirements are all consistent with experiments. The NIF laser design, at 1.8 MJ and 500 TW, has the margin to cover uncertainties in the baseline ignition targets. In addition, data from the NEF will provide a solid database for ion-beam-driven hohlraums being considered for future energy applications. In this paper we analyze the requirements for indirect drive ICF and review the theoretical and experimental basis for these requirements. Although significant parts of the discussion apply to both direct and indirect drive, the principal focus is on indirect drive. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {An inertial fusion implosion on the National Ignition Facility, conducted on August 8, 2021 (N210808), recently produced more than a megajoule of fusion yield and passed Lawson's criterion for ignition [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 075001 (2022)]. We describe the experimental improvements that enabled N210808 and present the first experimental measurements from an igniting plasma in the laboratory. Ignition metrics like the product of hot-spot energy and pressure squared, in the absence of self-heating, increased by ∼35{\%}, leading to record values and an enhancement from previous experiments in the hot-spot energy (∼3×), pressure (∼2×), and mass (∼2×). These results are consistent with self-heating dominating other power balance terms. The burn rate increases by an order of magnitude after peak compression, and the hot-spot conditions show clear evidence for burn propagation into the dense fuel surrounding the hot spot. These novel dynamics and thermodynamic properties have never been observed on prior inertial fusion experiments.},

These efforts have led to a change in paradigm for LPI research, ushering in an era of engineering LPI to accomplish specific objectives, from tuning capsule implosion symmetry to fixing nonlinear saturation of LPI processes at acceptable levels to enable the exploration of high energy density physics in novel plasma regimes. A tutorial is provided that reviews the progress in the field from the vantage of the foundational LPI experimental results. The pedagogical framework of the simplest models of LPI will be employed, but attention will also be paid to settings where more sophisticated models are needed to understand the observations.

abstract = {Using all-electron density functional theory, we have performed an ab initio study on x-ray absorption spectra of highly compressed polystyrene (CH). We found that the K-edge shifts in strongly coupled, degenerate polystyrene cannot be explained by existing continuum-lowering models adopted in traditional plasma physics. To gain insights into the K-edge shift in warm, dense CH, we have developed a model designated as "single mixture in a box" (SMIAB), which incorporates both the lowering of the continuum and the rising of the Fermi surface resulting from high compression. This simple SMIAB model correctly predicts the K-edge shift of carbon in highly compressed CH in good agreement with results from quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) calculations. Traditional opacity models failed to give the proper K-edge shifts as the CH density increased. Based on QMD calculations, we have established a first-principles opacity table (FPOT) for CH in a wide range of densities and temperatures [$\rho$=0.1-100g/cm3 and T=2000-1000000K]. The FPOT gives much higher Rosseland mean opacity compared to the cold-opacity-patched astrophysics opacity table for warm, dense CH and favorably compares to the newly improved Los Alamos atomic model for moderately compressed CH ($\rho$CH≤10g/cm3), but remains a factor of 2 to 3 higher at extremely high densities ($\rho$CH≥50g/cm3). We anticipate the established FPOT of CH will find important applications to reliable designs of high-energy-density experiments. Moreover, the understanding of K-edge shifting revealed in this study could provide guides for improving the traditional opacity models to properly handle the strongly coupled and degenerate conditions.},

abstract = {Radiative shocks are ubiquitous in stellar environments and are characterized by high temperature plasma emitting a considerable fraction of their energy as radiation. The physical structure of these shocks is complex and experimental benchmarks are needed to provide a deeper understanding of the physics at play. In addition, experiments provide unique data for testing radiation hydrodynamics codes which, in turn, are used to model astrophysical phenomena.Radiative shocks have been studied on various high-energy laser facilities for more than a decade, highlighting the importance of radiation on the plasma dynamics. Particularly the PALS facility has focused in producing radiative shocks with typical velocities of {\~{}}50-60 km s-1 in xenon at a fraction of a bar. In addition PALS has the unique capability of producing the most powerful XUV laser available today (21.2 nm (58.4 eV), 0.15 ns), opening the door to new diagnostics of dense plasmas. Here we present results of XUV imaging of the precursor and post-shock structure of radiative shocks generated in xenon in this facility, together with time-and-space resolved measurements of the XUV self-emission using fast diode. The experimental results are interpreted with the help of 2D ARWEN radiative hydrodynamics simulations and state-of-the art monochromatic opacities.},

abstract = {The wetted foam capsule design for inertial confinement fusion capsules, which includes a foam layer wetted with deuterium-tritium liquid, enables layered capsule implosions with a wide range of hot-spot convergence ratios (CR) on the National Ignition Facility. We present a full-scale wetted foam capsule design that demonstrates high gain in one-dimensional simulations. In these simulations, increasing the convergence ratio leads to an improved capsule yield due to higher hot-spot temperatures and increased fuel areal density. High-resolution two-dimensional simulations of this design are presented with detailed and well resolved models for the capsule fill tube, support tent, surface roughness, and predicted asymmetries in the x-ray drive. Our modeling of these asymmetries is validated by comparisons with available experimental data. In 2D simulations of the full-scale wetted foam capsule design, jetting caused by the fill tube is prevented by the expansion of the tungsten-doped shell layer due to preheat. While the impacts of surface roughness and predicted asymmetries in the x-ray drive are enhanced by convergence effects, likely underpredicted in 2D at high CR, simulations predict that the capsule is robust to these features. Nevertheless, the design is highly susceptible to the effects of the capsule support tent, which negates all of the one-dimensional benefits of increasing the convergence ratio. Indeed, when the support tent is included in simulations, the yield decreases as the convergence ratio is increased for CR {\textgreater} 20. Nevertheless, the results suggest that the full-scale wetted foam design has the potential to outperform ice layer capsules given currently achievable levels of asymmetries when fielded at low convergence ratios (CR {\textless} 20).},

abstract = {The physical properties of hot dense matter over a broad domain of the phase diagram are of immediate interest in astrophysics, planetary physics, power engineering, controlled thermonuclear fusion, impulse technologies, enginery, and sev-eral special applications. The use of intense shock waves in dynamic physics and high-pressure chemistry has made the exotic high-energy-density states of matter a subject of labora-tory experiments and enabled advancing by many orders of magnitude along the pressure scale to range into the megabars and even gigabars. The present report reviews the latest experi-mental research involving shock waves in nonideal plasmas under conditions of strong collective interparticle interaction. The results of investigations into the thermodynamic, transport, and optical properties of strongly compressed hot matter, as well as into its composition and conductivity, are discussed. Experimental techniques for high energy density cumulation, the drivers of intense shock waves, and methods for the fast diagnostics of high-energy plasma are considered. Also dis-cussed are compression-stimulated physical effects: pressure-induced ionization, plasma phase transitions, the deformation of bound states, plasma bloomingtransparentization' of plas-ma), etc. Suggestions for future research are put forward. 1. Prologue It is a great honor for me to take part in the special scientific session of the Editorial Board of the journal Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk dedicated to the jubilee of our outstand-ing compatriot Vitalii Lazarevich Ginzburg, whose person-ality and works have largely foreordained the contemporary level and progress of the physical sciences in our country. I, then a first-year student of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, was profoundly impressed by the review lecture dedicated to extreme astrophysical processes which Vitalii Lazarevich delivered in 1962. Over the years, the personality of this remarkable man has significantly influ-enced, directly or indirectly (primarily via Lev Vladimirovich Al'tshuler (in the center in the photograph), David Abramo-vich Kirzhnits, Evgenii Grigor'evich Maksimov and, of course, via the Seminar 1), the kind and direction of my scientific preferences. When preparing for this session of the Editorial Board, we agreed to adhere to th{\`{e}}list at the beginning of the XXI century', th{\`{e}}physical minimum', which was formulated by Vitalii Lazarevich in his Nobel Lecture.

@article{Lindl2014,
abstract = {The National Ignition Campaign (NIC) was a multi-institution effort established under the National Nuclear Security Administration of DOE in 2005, prior to the completion of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in 2009. The scope of the NIC was the planning and preparation for and the execution of the first 3 yr of ignition experiments (through the end of September 2012) as well as the development, fielding, qualification, and integration of the wide range of capabilities required for ignition. Besides the operation and optimization of the use of NIF, these capabilities included over 50 optical, x-ray, and nuclear diagnostic systems, target fabrication facilities, experimental platforms, and a wide range of NIF facility infrastructure. The goal of ignition experiments on the NIF is to achieve, for the first time, ignition and thermonuclear burn in the laboratory via inertial confinement fusion and to develop a platform for ignition and high energy density applications on the NIF. The goal of the NIC was to develop and integrate all of the capabilities required for a precision ignition campaign and, if possible, to demonstrate ignition and gain by the end of FY12. The goal of achieving ignition can be divided into three main challenges. The first challenge is defining specifications for the target, laser, and diagnostics with the understanding that not all ignition physics is fully understood and not all material properties are known. The second challenge is designing experiments to systematically remove these uncertainties. The third challenge is translating these experimental results into metrics designed to determine how well the experimental implosions have performed relative to expectations and requirements and to advance those metrics toward the conditions required for ignition. This paper summarizes the approach taken to address these challenges, along with the progress achieved to date and the challenges that remain. At project completion in 2009, NIF lacked almost all the diagnostics and infrastructure required for ignition experiments. About half of the 3 yr period covered in this review was taken up by the effort required to install and performance qualify the equipment and experimental platforms needed for ignition experiments. Ignition on the NIF is a grand challenge undertaking and the results presented here represent a snapshot in time on the path toward that goal. The path forward presented at the end of this review summarizes plans for the Ignition Campaign on the NIF, which were adopted at the end of 2012, as well as some of the key results obtained since the end of the NIC. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {This book is on inertial confinement fusion, an alternative way to produce electrical power from hydrogen fuel by using powerful lasers or particle beams. Two huge laser facilities are presently under construction to show that this method works. It involves the compression of tiny amounts (micrograms) of fuel to thousand times solid density and pressures otherwise existing only in the centre of stars. Thanks to advances in laser technology, it is now possible to produce such extreme states of matter in the laboratory. Recent developments have boosted laser intensities again with new possibilities for laser particle accelerators, laser nuclear physics, and fast ignition of fusion targets. This is a reference book for those working on beam plasma physics, be it in the context of fundamental research or applications to fusion energy or novel ultra-bright laser sources. The book combines quite different areas of physics: beam target interaction, dense plasmas, hydrodynamic implosion and instabilities, radiative energy transfer as well as fusion reactions. Particular attention is given to simple and useful modeling, including dimensional analysis and similarity solutions. Both authors have worked in this field for more than 20 years. They want to address in particular those teaching this topic to students and all those interested in understanding the technical basis.},

A two-dimensional particle-in-cell (2D PIC) simulation predicted well the deuteron spectrum. A 60 TW laser was used for MeV proton emissions and megagauss magnetic fields generation on the rear surface of a Poly p-xylene(C 8H 8) plane target. The 2D PIC simulation explained well the results. The PWM laser was upgraded to one PW, making it the world biggest Petawatt laser (PW laser). An optically parametric chirped amplification was introduced in the front end.

abstract = {Fast ignition is an approach to inertial fusion in which precompressed fuel is ignited with an external heat source. This arrangement can, in principle, lead to higher gains than conventional ignition produced by stagnation of convergent flows. In addition, because ignition is separate from the implosion in fast ignition, hydrodynamic mix has less opportunity to quench ignition than in the conventional process. This paper introduces some of the basic ideas of fast ignition: ignition requirements, gain curves based on simple energetic models, and integrated gain models including hohlraum and implosion physics. Because possible gains in this approach are so large, it is possible to examine the use of fuels with small tritium fractions, the so-called "advanced fuels." In addition, the historical background of this field is discussed.},

abstract = {Ultrahigh intensity lasers can potentially be used in conjunction with conventional fusion lasers to ignite inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsules with a total energy of a few tens of kilojoules of laser light, and can possibly lead to high gain with as little as 100 kJ. A scheme is proposed with three phases. First, a capsule is imploded as in the conventional approach to inertial fusion to assemble a high-density fuel configuration. Second, a hole is bored through the capsule corona composed of ablated material, as the critical density is pushed close to the high-density core of the capsule by the ponderomotive force associated with high-intensity laser light. Finally, the fuel is ignited by suprathermal electrons, produced in the high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, which then propagate from critical density to this high-density core. This new scheme also drastically reduces the difficulty of the implosion, and thereby allows lower quality fabrication and less stringent beam quality and symmetry requirements from the implosion driver. The difficulty of the fusion scheme is transferred to the technological difficulty of producing the ultrahigh-intensity laser and of transporting this energy to the fuel. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The coupling efficiency between the ignition laser and the target core for the fast ignition concept is studied using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The details of the energy transport within the weakly collisional overdense plasma of a fast ignition target are examined by performing a series of particle-in-cell simulations, where the intensity incident on a 100 times critical plasma with 50 $\mu$m radius is varied between each simulation. The simulations show that the peak energy flux of the ignition electrons is significantly lowered as the electrons traverse the collisionless plasma from the critical density through a weakly collisional overdense plasma region. This allows higher intensity lasers to be used thereby improving the coupling efficiency. In addition, we find that a higher percentage of the ignition laser energy is delivered to the core of the simulation target at higher intensity. The coupling efficiency increases in time during the simulations which are run for 2.5 ps. For a laser intensity of 8× 1020 W/ cm2 the simulations indicate that more than 15{\%} of the incident laser energy is eventually absorbed in a dense plasma core. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

Massive cryogenic shells are first imploded by direct laser light with a low implosion velocity and on a low adiabat leading to fuel assemblies with large areal densities. The assembled fuel is ignited from a central hot spot heated by the collision of a spherically convergent ignitor shock and the return shock. The resulting fuel assembly features a hot-spot pressure greater than the surrounding dense fuel pressure. Such a nonisobaric assembly requires a lower energy threshold for ignition than the conventional isobaric one. The ignitor shock can be launched by a spike in the laser power or by particle beams.

abstract = {Shock ignition enables high gain at low implosion velocity, reducing ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth, which can degrade conventional direct drive. With this method, driving a strong shock requires high laser power and intensity, resulting in inefficiencies in the drive and the generation of hot electrons that can preheat the fuel. A new "shock-augmented ignition" pulse shape is described that, by preconditioning the ablation plasma before launching a strong shock, enables the shock ignition of thermonuclear fuel, but importantly, with substantially reduced laser power and intensity requirements. The reduced intensity requirement with respect to shock ignition limits laser-plasma instabilities, such as stimulated Raman and Brillouin scatter, reducing the risk of hot-electron preheat and restoring the laser coupling advantages of conventional direct drive. Simulations indicate that, due to the reduced power requirements, high gain (∼100) ignition of large-scale direct drive implosions (outer radius ∼1750 $\mu$m, deuterium-tritium ice thickness ∼165 $\mu$m) may be possible within the power and energy limits of existing facilities such as the National Ignition Facility. Moreover, this concept extends to indirect drive implosions, which exhibit substantial yield increases at reduced implosion velocity. Shock-augmented ignition expands the viable design space of laser inertial fusion. Laser inertial confinement fusion [1] uses a spherical implosion to integrate incident photon flux in space and time, converting it first into implosion kinetic energy, then, at stagnation, into internal energy. In direct drive, the lasers impinge directly on the implosion capsule. Indirect drive uses a high-Z enclosure (a hohlraum) to absorb the laser energy before it is reemitted as x rays, which drive the implosion. The capsule is a spherical low-Z shell containing deuterium (D) and tritium (T) fuel. The low-Z shell ablates; photon absorption raises the pressure of the shell's exterior, driving an outward plasma expansion that, through conservation of momentum, accelerates the shell inward. In this way, a significant fraction of the incident photon flux is absorbed, a proportion of which is converted into implosion kinetic energy. As the implosion proceeds, volume reduction due to spherical convergence, combined with shock heating, creates a low-density, hot, and high-pressure "hot spot" at the center of the dense fuel shell. This central pressure decelerates the converging shell, converting the shell's kinetic energy into internal energy, compressing the DT hot spot and shell. If the compressed hot spot's temperature (T) and density-radius product ($\rho$R) are sufficient ($\rho$R {\textgreater} 0.3 g cm −2 , T {\textgreater} 5 keV), fusion $\alpha$ particles are emitted that stop within the hot spot, further heating it, causing additional $\alpha$-particle emission. A thermonuclear burn wave then propagates into the surrounding dense fuel shell, creating net energy release: ignition. Laser inertial-fusion implosion designs seek to optimally balance multiple implosion degradation mechanisms. The shock-augmented ignition (SAI) concept described in this Letter enables a strong shock to be generated without the requirement for high peak intensity or power in laser direct drive, nor the requirement for extreme radiation temperature rise rates in indirect drive. In doing so, it combines the advantages of shock ignition with those of central hot spot ignition [2]. This reduces challenges associated with the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) [3,4] caused by the high implosion velocity required for central hot spot ignition and those caused by laser-plasma instabilities [5] due to the high laser intensities required for shock ignition (SI) [6]. The key innovation of the SAI approach is the introduction of a brief reduction in laser power preceding a rapid rise in power. The dip in the flux driving the ablation process acts to precondition the ablation plasma in the shock-formation region; then once the laser power rises again, the characteristics of the preconditioned ablation plasma aid shock generation. Direct drive central hot spot ðDD CHS Þ designs are restricted to laser intensities ≤ 1.3 × 10 15 W cm −2 to reduce the impact of laser-plasma instabilities (LPIs) [7]. Two plasmon decay [8] and stimulated Raman scatter (SRS) [9] stimulate the growth of electron-plasma waves (EPWs) in the underdense ablated plasma. The EPWs accelerate electrons to high energy; these "hot electrons" can then deposit energy within the imploding DT fuel, potentially preheating it, thereby reducing the fuel's compressibility [2].

It has also been shown that reducing the size of the target can significantly affect the K production from the targets. The use of reduced-mass target can also increase temperature up to 1keV level, which provides an excellent platform for fast electron transport without assembling the fuel. The pre-pulse is a significant issue in fast ignition for fast electron coupling to the compressed core. Indeed, we have shown using a variety of targets that the laser pre-pulse can significantly reduce transfer of energy farther into the target. In this article, we show that a significant progress has been made in understanding the critical issues of fast electron transport pertinent to fast ignition (FI). This understanding will facilitate a better target design for large scale FI integrated experiments when laser facilities become available. {\textcopyright} 2014 IAEA, Vienna.},

While many groups employ the use of dopants to reduce or block preheat, direct quantification has not previously been explored. We developed a planar platform and a series of ablator targets to measure the electron and x-ray spectra generated by laser-plasma interactions with a direct drive using OMEGA-60. By comparing both thin ablators (75m) and thick ablators (270 m) that were either pure CH, 3{\%} Si doped or 3{\%} I doped, we were able to measure differences in electron and x-ray spectra. In addition, we observed the preheat growth of tracer layers and observed reductions in the growth with different materials. We find that iodine or a thin gold layer is the best at tamping the direct-drive preheat at OMEGA, but that the growth is still significant.},

Unlike in shorter-scale-length plasmas on OMEGA, scattered-light data on the NIF show that the near-quarter-critical LPI physics is dominated by stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) rather than by two-plasmon decay (TPD). This difference in regime is explained based on absolute SRS and TPD threshold considerations. SRS sidescatter tangential to density contours and other SRS mechanisms are observed. The fraction of laser energy converted to hot electrons is ∼0.7{\%} to 2.9{\%}, consistent with observed levels of SRS. The intensity threshold for hot-electron production is assessed, and the use of a Si ablator slightly increases this threshold from ∼4×1014 to ∼6×1014 W/cm2.

abstract = {In this paper, we present the results of high-resolution simulations of the implosion of high-convergence layered indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion capsules of the type fielded on the National Ignition Facility using the xRAGE radiation-hydrodynamics code. In order to evaluate the suitability of xRAGE to model such experiments, we benchmark simulation results against available experimental data, including shock-timing, shock-velocity, and shell trajectory data, as well as hydrodynamic instability growth rates. We discuss the code improvements that were necessary in order to achieve favorable comparisons with these data. Due to its use of adaptive mesh refinement and Eulerian hydrodynamics, xRAGE is particularly well suited for high-resolution study of multi-scale engineering features such as the capsule support tent and fill tube, which are known to impact the performance of high-convergence capsule implosions. High-resolution two-dimensional (2D) simulations including accurate and well-resolved models for the capsule fill tube, support tent, drive asymmetry, and capsule surface roughness are presented. These asymmetry seeds are isolated in order to study their relative importance and the resolution of the simulations enables the observation of details that have not been previously reported. We analyze simulation results to determine how the different asymmetries affect hotspot reactivity, confinement, and confinement time and how these combine to degrade yield. Yield degradation associated with the tent occurs largely through decreased reactivity due to the escape of hot fuel mass from the hotspot. Drive asymmetries and the fill tube, however, degrade yield primarily via burn truncation, as associated instability growth accelerates the disassembly of the hotspot. Modeling all of these asymmetries together in 2D leads to improved agreement with experiment but falls short of explaining the experimentally observed yield degradation, consistent with previous 2D simulations of such capsules.},

Plasmas 6 3316; Tabak M. et al 2006 Fusion Sci. Technol. 49 254). These gain models, however, all assume nearly uniform density fuel assemblies. In contrast, conventional ICF implosions yield hollowed fuel assemblies with a high-density shell of fuel surrounding a low-density, high-pressure hot spot. Hence, to realize fully the advantages of FI, an alternative implosion design must be found which yields nearly isochoric fuel assemblies without substantial hot spots. Here, it is shown that a self-similar spherical implosion of the type originally studied by Guderley (1942 Luftfahrtforschung 19 302) may be employed to yield precisely such quasi-isochoric imploded states. The difficulty remains, however, of accessing these self-similarly imploding configurations from initial conditions representing an actual ICF target, namely a uniform, solid-density shell at rest. Furthermore, these specialized implosions must be realized for practicable drive parameters and at the scales and energies of interest in ICF. A direct-drive implosion scheme is presented which meets all of these requirements and reaches a nearly isochoric assembled density of 300 g cm-3 and areal density of 2.4 g cm-2 using 485 kJ of laser energy. {\textcopyright} 2007 IAEA.},

The LDD programme is primarily being executed at both the Omega Laser Facility at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics and at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. LDD research at Omega includes cryogenic implosions, fundamental physics including material properties, hydrodynamics and laser-plasma interaction physics. LDD research on the NIF is focused on energy coupling and laser-plasma interactions physics at ignition-scale plasmas. Limited implosions on the NIF in the 'polar-drive' configuration, where the irradiation geometry is configured for LID, are also a feature of LDD research. The ability to conduct research over a large range of energy, power and scale size using both Omega and the NIF is a major positive aspect of LDD research that reduces the risk in scaling from OMEGA to megajoule-class lasers. The paper will summarize the present status of LDD research and plans for the future with the goal of ultimately achieving a burning plasma in the laboratory.

abstract = {We propose a novel method to minimize laser-plasma instabilities and improve laser-plasma coupling by the use of multi-beam laser architecture with a large system frequency bandwidth and many beamlets per unit solid angle. The StarDriver™, laser driver is constructed from 104to 10 5individual lasers, each delivering nominally 100 J in pulses of ∼3-30 ns at a nominal wavelength of ∼355 nm with better than 3-5 diffraction-limited performance. The beamlets are individually relatively narrowband to facilitate maximum laser performance, but the ensemble of beamlets span a wide frequency range. Currently available laser media enable $\Delta$$\omega$/$\omega$ ∼ 2 {\%} at 355 nm with the possibility of system bandwidths approaching 10 {\%} in the future. The many beamlets of StarDriver™ provide optimal asymptotic smoothing for hydrodynamic instabilities (0-1 {\%}), innovative focusing strategies including zooming, and the large bandwidth enables extremely rapid hydrodynamic smoothing times ∼30 fs. The distribution of frequencies among the beamlets allows flexibility for fine control of the seeding of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The ultra-broad bandwidth combined with the large total k-spectrum of the laser drive in the plasma corona may enable complete suppression of the most problematic laser-plasma instabilities such as stimulated Brillouin backscatter, stimulated Raman scatter, cross-beam energy transfer, and the two plasmon decay instability. StarDriver™ offers potentially superior flexibility in laser drivers for inertial confinement fusion, enabling almost arbitrary sequencing of wavelength, polarization, focus, and fine control of the spatio-temporal properties of the drive in the corona. The highly modular strategy of StarDriver™ should enable an attractive development pathway as well as maximizing overall system efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},
