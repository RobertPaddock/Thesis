\chapter{\label{ch-lowCR}Low convergence ratio implosions}

\minitoc

\section{Introduction}

Wetted-foam ICF capsules, consisting of a low-density foam saturated with liquid DT, can be used in place of conventional DT ice capsules. The use of liquid (rather than frozen) DT means that such capsules are fielded at a higher initial temperature, between 20 and 26K. This higher temperature leads to a higher density of DT vapour within the central void of the capsule, ranging between 0.6 and 4.0 \unit{\milli\gram\per\centi\meter\cubed} \cite{Olson2016}. Higher vapour densities lead to less capsule convergence, and thus varying the temperature of wetted-foam capsules provides an excellent opportunity to explore how implosion physics varies with convergence.

In ideal (1D) implosions, increasing the convergence ratio of the capsule leads to higher areal densities, and higher fusion yields. However, it has also been demonstrated that lower convergence implosions are less susceptible to hydrodynamic instability growth, and initial experiments at the National Ignition Facility using low convergence-ratio implosions of wetted foam capsules demonstrated good agreement with simulations  \cite{Olson2016, Zylstra2018}. The experimental fusion yield of a capsule is a balance of two effects: the increase in ideal fusion yield as the convergence ratio increases, and the decrease in agreement between experiment and simulation.

In this chapter, the possible fusion yield of low-convergence ratio implosions of wetted-foam capsules is explored in a large-scale simulation campaign. A regime was identified (based on low-convergence ratio, and other implosion criteria) where instability growth is expected to be low, and one-dimensional simulations would provide a reasonable estimate of expected performance. This was intended as a first exploration of what may be possible in such a regime; if sufficiently high fusion performance could be obtained, it may be the case that this coupled with the higher-than-typical agreement between simulation and experiment in this regime may in fact outperform higher convergence implosions in experiments.

In \hl{Section}, the results of previous experiments and simulation efforts relevant to low-convergence implosions are discussed. In \hl{Section} a range of different parameters influencing instability growth is considered - culminating in four criteria to minimise instability growth used to define this new regime, and thus (hopefully) ensuring that 1D simulations are reasonably accurate. Then, in \hl{Section}, a range of key parameters used for this work are discussed and defined (so that they can be quantified for the simulated implosions). The capsule design and laser pulse sequence that will be used in the simulation campaign is then considered in \hl{Section}. Section \hl{Section} will then briefly touch on the details of the simulations themselves. The procedure for the simulation campaign (and how the different implosions are optimised) is then discussed in \hl{Section}, before the results are presented in \hl{Section}. Finally, the limitations of this approach are considered, and ways that the work could be developed further are discussed.



%One of the promising possibilities that wetted foam capsules enable is a degree of control over the convergence ratio that is not possible with conventional capsules. Wetted-foam targets contain liquid DT wicked in a carbon foam. They are thus fielded at higher temperatures between 20 and 26 K (where DT is in liquid form), which in turn leads to higher vapour pressures ranging from 0.6 \unit{\milli\gram\per\centi\meter\cubed} to 4.0 \unit{\milli\gram\per\centi\meter\cubed}. These higher vapour pressures enable lower convergence ratios to be achieved. Not only this, but it also provides a way to control the convergence ratio largely independently from other implosion properties, by varying the temperature at which the capsule is fielded \footnote{Doing this has a small impact on some of the other properties, but this is essentially negligible.}. This enables the impact of convergence ratio on an ICF implosion to be explored.

%The first wetted foam target was shot on the NIF in 2016, in shot N160421. The results were interesting; neutron yield of \hl{VALUES} were achieved, which were promising and suggested a good level of performance could be achieved with these capsules. More promising however was the fact that agreement between the experimental and simulated results were high, suggesting a capsule that was performing roughly as expected, and without significant instability growth. Further shots presented by Zylstra \textit{et al.} confirmed this, and showed explicitly the link with convergence ratio. At low convergence ratio, the agreement with 2D simulations were very high, and as this increased the agreement rapidly began to get worse. 

%This raised the prospect of a new, alternative approach to ICF experiments. Previous approaches had targeted high convergence ratio implosions with very large gains, but failed to achieve them due to poor agreement with simulations - efforts were then ongoing to improve this agreement by reducing the instability growth. The alternative to this would be to operate at low-convergence ratio, in a regime where the agreement between simulation and experiment inherently appeared to be high. If performance could be explored in this regime in simulations and a high-performing design could be identified, then it could be reasonably expected that the experimental performance would also be high. The question was whether it would be possible to achieve sufficiently high performance at low convergence ratio to make such an approach worthwhile.

%The other benefit of this approach was that these low convergence ratio implosions were exhibiting low instability growth. This meant that the performance of such implosions could be reasonably well approximated as one-dimensional, allowing 1D simulations to be used to explore the performance. As 1D codes are relatively simple and quick to run (particularly compared to their 2D or 3D equivalents), this meant that a large-scale simulation campaign would be feasible.

%Such a campaign was therefore performed to explore the possible performance of wetted-foam capsules at low convergence ratio at a range of laser energies, and is described in this chapter. First, some of the previous results of low-convergence work is discussed, and the NIF shots are considered in further detail. Secondly, in an attempt to ensure instability growth is minimal and thus 1D simulations are accurate, other 1D implosion properties that correlate with instability growth are considered; a low-instability regime is thus identified which will set the boundaries for this campaign. Definitions of key parameters are then defined, describing the key metrics through which the simulated implosions will be judged.

S%ection then discussed the form of the implosions considered, in terms of the laser profile and the capsule design. The simulation code and paramters used to simulate these implosions are then discussed in SECTION, before SECTION discusses how the simulation campaign was actually performed and conducted. The results achieved in this campaign are then presented and discussed in SECTION, before a discussion of the limitations of this campaign and the efforts taken to model the impact of these. Finally, a discussion on benchmarking of the code is included.

\section{Wetted foam capsules and low convergence ratio}

\subsection{Experimental results}

The first DT-wetted foam shot on the NIF (designated N160421) was performed in 2016, and was reported on by Olson \textit{et al.} \cite{Olson2016}. The results were interesting; a promising $(4.5 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{14}$ neutrons were generated, which suggested that a good level of performance could be achieved with such implosions. More impressive however was the close agreement between the simulation and experiment. 2D simulations were able to match a wide range of implosion metrics (including temperatures, bang time, hotspot radius and inferred pressures) to within the experimental error. These metrics were also very well described even by a 1D RAGE simulation (with a mix model included), which gave a ratio between experimental and simulated yield of nearly 80 \%. 

N160421, and subsequent wetted-foam shots N160626 and N161204, were then discussed by Zylstra \textit{et al.} \cite{Zylstra2018} in 2018. These three shots spanned a convergence ratio range of 12-20. This confirmed that convergence ratio could indeed be controlled using initial capsule temperature. These shots were then simulated using the HYDRA and xRAGE codes. The agreement was again very good at low convergence ratio (with yield and ion temperature agreeing to within 5 \% for N160421 with a convergence ratio of 12), but the discrepancy increased with convergence ratio resulting in a experimental yield for the CR=20 shot that was only 30 \% of that predicted by the simulation. The intermediate shot, with a convergence ratio between 16 and 17, showed a good agreement of above 70 \%\footnote{It should be noted that the exact reason for this discrepancy could not be identified in \cite{Zylstra2018}.}. These NIF shots therefore showed that wetted-foam capsules could be used to generate low-convergence ratio shots on the NIF, and that the agreement with simulations at low-convergence ratio was relatively high.

This was not the first time a link between low convergence-ratio and agreement with simulation was observed; the same result is highlighted in the following (non-exhaustive) collection of references \cite{Kato1996, Nishimura2000, Meyerhofer2001, Li2002, Lindl2004, LePape2014, Khan2016, Haines2017a}. This agreement was identified as far back as 1980 \cite{Key1980}, where it was observed that lower initial aspect ratios (thicker shells as a function of radius - resulting in lower implosion velocities and less convergence) resulted in performance that was more 1D-like; the low laser energies available at the time however made it unfeasible to pursue high gain in this regime. The other innovation provided by wetted-foams was the ability to vary convergence ratio (almost) independently from other parameters, by varying the initial temperature and thus vapour density of the capsule.

While the NIF shots discussed so far were indirect-drive, similar links between convergence ratio and 1D-like performance have also been observed in direct-drive shots on Omega. Regan \textit{et al.} observed that the hotspot pressure and compressed areal density of capsules using DT ice layers (rather than wetted-foams) reached 90 \% of the 1D simulated values for convergence ratios below 17 and adiabats greater than 3.5 \cite{Regan2016}. When the convergence ratio was increased past 17 a rapid drop-off occurred, which shows good qualitative agreement with the trend in yield observed on the NIF shots. This shows that this relationship applied for both indirect and direct-drive implosions, using both DT-ice or DT-wetted foam layers.


\subsection{Simulation work} 

This topic has also been explored through simulation work. 2D simulations were previously used to investigate how the yield of wetted foam capsules with varying vapour density (and thus convergence ratio) changed, for different amplitudes of a Legendre $P_4$ flux asymmetry. As expected, they found that the higher vapour density / lower convergence ratio implosions were significantly more robust to this instability, with a higher ratio of 2D to 1D yield \cite{Olson2013}. Simulations performed in preparation for the NIF shots suggested that sensitivity to capsule instability growth and x-ray flux assymmetries increased with convergence ratio, leading to strong agreement between 2D and 1D simulations for CR=15 shots when surface roughness was applied compared to much worse agreement for high convergence ratio shots - leading to a hypothesis that using low convergence ratios would lead to reduced instability growth and a robust predictive capability \cite{Olson2016a}. 

High resolution 2D xRAGE simulations performed in 2017 investigated full-scale wetted foam capsules with a variety of `asymmetry seeds'. These simulations showed when only surface roughness and drive asymmetries were included yield increased with convergence ratio through the range of 12<CR<20, but  that when the capsule support tent and fill tube were included the yield was roughly constant as a function of convergence up to CR=20, at which point it began to decrease \cite{Haines2017a}. It was identified that it was the capsule support tent that was largely seeding this instability growth in that case. Despite this, the paper concluded "as the level of these asymmetries is reduced, the wetted foam platform will enable layered implosions to be fielded at convergence ratios that optimize the trade-off between enhanced 1D performance and increased implosion instability as the convergence ratio is increased". A number of developments since that work have been found to reduce the amplitude of these instability seeds. Alternative designs for supporting the capsule have been proposed have been proposed \cite{Weber2017, Hammel2018a} and have led to improved capsule performance \cite{Hammel2018a}. In addition to this, the fill tube diameter has been significantly reduced since the 2017 simulations (the N210808 shot had a 2 \unit{\micro\meter} fill tube \cite{Abu-Shawareb2022}), leading again to less yield degradation and improved performance \cite{Weber2020, Pak2020}. Indeed, in 2019 xRage simulations of a wetted-foam capsule with a plastic shell at CR = 19 showed good agreement with experiment \cite{Haines2019a}, suggesting that instabilities can indeed be controlled (even at higher convergence ratios) if asymmetry seeds are well mitigated - although a similar implosion with larger seeds again showed significant yield degradation, again highlighting the impact of the seed amplitude.

There are some differences between the simulations presented in \cite{Haines2017a} and the designs considered in this chapter, but these are unlikely to have too much of an impact. For instance, \cite{Haines2017a} found that the capsule support tent was a major asymmetry seed leading to large instability growth; the support tent is unique to indirect-drive, but direct-drive implosions require stalks to hold the capsule in place which will likely also have a significant effect. Stalks have been shown to outperform silk-strings (the alternative capsule support for direct-drive), but still lead to significant yield degradation compared to experiment \cite{Igumenshchev2009}. The exact impact of capsule stalks has not been quantified to the same degree as support tents, and research into this is still ongoing. Simulation work has suggested that 10-20 \% yield degradation due to stalk, but did not observe differences in experiments between shots (but yield was much lower in all shots) \cite{Shah2017}, while more recent work suggested that the stalk is indeed important but could not quantify the effect on yield \cite{GatuJohnson2020}. The other significant difference from the implosions considered in this chapter is the use in \cite{Haines2017a} of a high-density carbon (HDC) ablator. Such ablators are typically more susceptible to the effects of the fill tube, but may be more robust to the capsule support tent compared to CH \cite{Zylstra2022, Abu-Shawareb2022, Haines2019a, Clark2018}. It has been observed that if the first shock used to compress the target is not strong enough to melt the HDC shell, then the imprint from the support tent and microstructures in the HDC \footnote{the HDC microstructure was not considered in \cite{Haines2017a}} may seed significant instability growth \cite{Mackinnon2014, Haines2019a}; the simulated design in the 2017 xRAGE simulations had a weak first shock, and the authors noted that was likely responsible for the observed instability growth \cite{Haines2017a}. xRAGE simulations of HDC ablator targets using stronger initial shocks demonstrate that the tent caused only a 1 \% reduction of the 2D yield \cite{Haines2019a}, highlighting that this can indeed be well mitigated using a strong first shock (this was also seen in the xRAGE simulations of N160421, the first liquid layer DT shot, with a higher adiabat).

\subsection{Implications of these previous findings} 
The significance of these previous results are clear. The use of low-convergence ratio has been demonstrated in both simulations and in experiments to reduce instability growth, and as convergence ratio is increased yield degradation due to instabilities is observed to increase. However, the xRAGE simulations investigating the impact of convergence ratio \cite{Haines2017a} also show that low-convergence alone isn't sufficient to mitigate instability growth, and that control of asymmetry seeds is also essential for ensuring high fusion yields (and indeed, reduced asymmetry seeds helped contribute to recent high gain experiments \cite{Zylstra2022}).

%High resolution 2D xRAGE simulations performed in 2017 of full-scale wetted foam capsules including surface roughness and drive asymmetries found that yield increased with convergence ratio through the range of 12<CR<20, but found that when the capsule support tent and fill tube were included, the yield was roughly constant as a function of convergence up to CR=20, at which point it began to decrease \cite{Haines2017a}. This discrepancy was largely caused by the capsule support tent.

%However, a range of factors should be considered in interpreting this result. Recent NIF shots (including the DT wetted-foam shots) have used high-density carbon (HDC) shells; these have a higher density and thus higher ablative pressure than the previous plastic (CH) shells. HDC ablators are more susceptible to the effects of the fill tube, but are typically more robust to the capsule support tent compared to CH \cite{Zylstra2022, Abu-Shawareb2022, Haines2019a, Clark2018}. The caveat here is that the first shock should be strong enough to melt the HDC shell; otherwise, microstructures in the HDC may seed instability growth \cite{Mackinnon2014, Haines2019a}. The simulated design in the 2017 xRAGE simulations had a weak first shock, and the authors noted that this made these implosions particularly susceptible to instabilities seeded by the tent \cite{Haines2017a}; as demonstrated by the fact that xRAGE simulations of HDC ablator targets with stronger initial shocks demonstrate that the tent caused only a 1 \% reduction of the 2D yield \cite{Haines2019a}. The xRAGE simulations of N160421 (the first liquid layer DT shot, with a higher adiabat) also demonstrated a much smaller amount of yield degradation from this effect. 

%It's also worth noting the significant improvements that have been made since these 2017 simulations. Alternative designs for supporting the capsule have been proposed have been proposed \cite{Weber2017, Hammel2018a} and have led to improved capsule performance \cite{Hammel2018a}. In addition to this, the fill tube diameter has been significantly reduced since the 2017 simulations (the N210808 shot had a 2 \unit{\micro\meter} fill tube \cite{Abu-Shawareb2022}), leading again to less yield degradation and improved performance \cite{Weber2020, Pak2020}. These improvements may mean that some of the yield degradation observed in the 2017 simulations could be reduced, meaning that some increase in performance with convergence ratio (while staying in the CR<20 convergence ratio range discussed) may indeed lead to increased performance. This matches the conclusion made in that paper, which stated "as the level of these asymmetries is reduced, the wetted foam platform will enable layered implosions to be fielded at convergence ratios that optimize the trade-off between enhanced 1D performance and increased implosion instability as the convergence ratio is increased" - which is the intention of this chapter.

%Simulations of wetted foam with plastic shell at CR = 19 showed good agreement \cite{Haines2019a}, suggesting instabilities can be controlled. However, very conservative. Similar experiment with high asymmetry seeds showed significant yield degradation. When asymmetry seeds are suppressed (i.e. strong shock), then instability growth can be suppressed too.

%Stalks used for direct drive rather than tents. Initial simulation work suggested that stalks outperformed silk string, but still caused significant degradation \cite{Igumenshchev2009}. Simulation work suggested 10-20 \% yield degradation due to stalk, but did not observe differences in experiments between shots (but yield was much lower in all shots) \cite{Shah2017}. Recent work suggested that the stalk was indeed important, but could not quantify the effect on yield \cite{GatuJohnson2020}. Other simulations showed that lonw-wavelength asymmetries, including the target mount, were required to match experimental data.

\section{Defining a `low-instability' regime}

In this chapter, the performance of low-convergence ratio implosions is explored using one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations. 1D simulations are used for this investigation as they are relatively fast to run (taking a few hours each), and so large numbers can be performed to effectively explore the available parameter space. However, they are limited in that they do not include hydrodynamic instabilities (and other two or three dimensional effects); and thus it is essential that instability growth is minimal if the simulations are to provide a reasonable estimate of performance. Thus, a regime was identified where this is expected to be the case, and thus such simulations can be expected to be reasonably accurate.

The key feature of this regime is the low-convergence ratio of the implosions, which as discussed previously is known to minimise lead to reduced instability growth. For this work a definition for low-convergence ratio of $CR<16$ was used. This value was chosen as an expected reasonable compromise between two competing effects; the expected increased 1D fusion yield with convergence ratio, and the decreased agreement between experiment and simulation. A CR of 16 would likely give a much higher 1D yield than lowest CR of 12 discussed by Olson \textit{et al.} \cite{Olson2016}, but still fits within the CR range where Olson \textit{et al.} \cite{Olson2016} and Zylstra \textit{et al.} \cite{Zylstra2018} observed reasonable agreement with simulation\footnote{ The xRAGE simulations in \cite{Haines2017a} predicted that such a CR value would fit in the range where yield was flat with performance; this would predict that there was no advantage or disadvantage compared to a lower CR value, but as discussed previously it is likely that the level of instability growth seen in that work could be mitigated, resulting in a more positive trend between CR and performance.}. 

%these this previous work, and in particular the previous experimental results presented in Olson \textit{et al.} \cite{Olson2016} and Zylstra \textit{et al.} \cite{Zylstra2018}, it was decided to investigate the performance of low-convergence ratio capsules. A definition for low-convergence ratio of $CR<16$ was chosen; this allowed for a higher ideal yield than would likely be possible for the lowest $CR$ values they considered, but remained firmly in the regime investigated in those experiments (and where agreement would still be expected to be reasonably high)\footnote{Preliminary simulations were performed in Nym by Warren Garbett, and in Helios by Heath Martin and Rusko Ruskov, as an initial investigation of the performance that may be achievable for low-CR capsules using direct-drive. My work presented here then significantly expanded and explored this idea.}.

However, a number of additional implosion parameters are also know to influence instability growth. A particularly useful reference for the role of different parameters on such implosions is the review article by Craxton \textit{et al.}\cite{Craxton2015}. As such, a number of additional parameters were identified which should be controlled in order to ensure minimal instability growth, alongside the limit on convergence ratio.

In-flight aspect ratio is well known to be a key parameter for hydrodynamic instability growth (IFAR). IFAR, defined in \hl{SECTION}, is a measure of the thickness of the capsule shell compared to the capsule radius. Thinner shells are more susceptible to instability growth and breaking up, and thus a low IFAR value is desirable. By making some assumptions about the nature of the implosion, it is possible to describe the grwoth-rate of RT instabilities in terms of IFAR, 
\begin{equation} G_l = exp \left[ \alpha_1 \left( \frac{l}{l + \alpha_2 \cdot l \cdot (\mathrm{IFAR})^{-1}} \right)^{1/2} - \alpha_3 \cdot l \cdot (\mathrm{IFAR})^{-1} \right], \label{eq: IFARGrowth} \end{equation} $l$ is the spherical harmonic mode number, and the three $\alpha$ values are numerical constants \cite{Atzeni2008}. This expression describes RT instability growth at the capsule outer surface during the acceleration of the shell; the fact that an expression for RT growth can be derived that depends solely on this parameter highlights it's significance. As a result, a criteria for the IFAR of the implosion was also define. An upper limit of $\textrm{IFAR<30}$ was selected, as previous works noted this as a rough threshold above which significant instability growth and risk of capsule break-up was observed \cite{Lindl1995} (although it should be noted that some works suggest that even lower IFAR values are preferable \cite{Radha2011, Goncharov2003}).

Another key ICF parameter is the implosion velocity of the capsule, or how quickly the shell moves towards the center of the capsule. Implosion velocity does not directly appear in the equations for hydrodynamic instability growth, which instead feature acceleration \cite{Atzeni2008}. The implosion velocity is however a more widely reported parameter, and can in some way provide a limit on acceleration (since a lower velocity means that lower acceleration is likely experienced within the capsule). However, this parameter is also important in ensuring a realistic implosion. Implosion velocity is related to ion temperature and yield, and thus higher implosion velocities give better performing capsules - yet high implosion velocities are challenging to achieve experimentally. A value of 400 \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second} was chosen as an upper limit for implosion velocity; this represents a rough upper limit for the velocities that have been achieved in previous experiments \cite{Craxton2015, Callahan2015}, suggesting these velocities are indeed feasible\footnote{The recent 210808 shot was simulated to have an implosion velocity of 391 \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second}, which again demonstrates that 400 \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second} is a reasonable upper limit \cite{Kritcher2022}.}.

The other parameter which is known to significantly influence instability growth is adiabat. DT-fuel at lower adiabat is more compressible and thus results in a higher ideal gain, the higher ablative velocities achieved at higher adiabat are key for the suppression of hydrodynamic instability growth \cite{Betti2016}. Initial implosions on the NIF targeted very low adiabat \cite{Lindl2014}, which was a key part of the reason for the poor experimental performance - significant improvement was found using 'high-foot' higher adiabat implosions \cite{Hurricane2014}. This effect is coupled with the `strong-first shock' discussed in the xRAGE simulations in \cite{Haines2017a}, as altering the strength of the first shock is the most significant way of changing the adiabat \cite{Robey2013,Haines2017a,Haines2019a}. The importance of adiabat has also given rise to adiabat shaping techniques, where the outer fuel layer is placed on a higher adiabat than the inner fuel; doing so minimises the instability growth at the outer edge, while keeping the inner fuel on a lower adiabat to maximise compressability \cite{Goncharov2003}.

No limit on adiabat was set on this work. Firstly, adiabat is particularly ambiguous (as discussed in \hl{section}) in terms of how it is calculated and reported, which makes comparison with literature values (and implementation in the analysis code) challenging. Secondly, the main technique used to influence adiabat is changing the strength of the shocks, which is a parameter which was treated as fixed in this simulation work (as discussed in the later \hl{section}). It is also worth noting that these parameters are not independent, and mathematical relationships exist between many of these parameters (such as implosion velocity and convergence ratio, or convergence ratio and adiabat \cite{Goncharov2013, Landen2021}), and thus it was also hoped that a high adiabat may arise as a consequence of the limits on other parameters\footnote{ Previous research has also suggested that the combination of multiple parameters is important for 1D like behaviour; for instance, requiring low IFAR and high adiabat \cite{Goncharov2014}, or high adiabat and low convergence ratio \cite{Goncharov2003}. For the approach taken here, such limits were not used and each variable was considered independently against the outlined criteria.}. The lack of focus on adiabat (or first shock strength) is a potential limitation of this work, and is something that could be addressed in further simulation campaigns, as discussed in \hl{section}.

It's also worth noting the recent statistical mapping model produced using a large database of Omega implosions \cite{Lees2021}, which highlights how a number of parameters contribute to yield degradation. This model was published after the work done in this chapter was performed, and so was not used in identifying the instability criteria. This mapping model included a term related to hydrodynamic instability, which included IFAR and adiabat (linked through the relation identified in \cite{Goncharov2014}), and convergence ratio. It identified that the agreement between experiment and simulation scaled with convergence to the power of -0.97.

%It is also worth noting that these parameters are not independent. For example, a thin shell will result in a high IFAR, but also a high implosion velocity (due to the relatively low mass of the shell being accelerated). This will also likely result in a high convergence ratio. Mathematical relations can be derived between some of these parameters; for instance, between implosion velocity and convergence ratio. Previous research has also suggested that the combination of multiple parameters is important for 1D like behaviour; for instance, requiring low IFAR and high adiabat \cite{Goncharov2014}, or high adiabat and low convergence ratio \cite{Goncharov2003}. For the purposes of the optimisation these parameters are treated independently, ensuring that the value of each variable is sufficient to minimise growth. This also (hopefully) ensures that despite adiabat not being strictly controlled, it will be compensated for by the other parameters - and indeed, requiring that these parameters are appropriately valued may also result in a well-controlled adiabat.

This discussion has so far related to hydrodynamic instability growth, but parametric instabilities arising from laser plasma interactions are also a concern. Such instabilities lead to decreased laser absorption, and can also result in the generation of hot electrons which preheat the fuel, making it harder to compress and reducing the yield \cite{Rosenberg2018, Yaakobi2000}. A fourth criteria was set,
\begin{equation} I \cdot \lambda^2 < 1 \times 10^{14} \: (\unit{\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}) \cdot \unit{\micro\meter\squared}, \end{equation}
where $I$ is the laser intensity and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. This is a threshold above which significant amounts of parametric instabilities begin to be observed \cite{Montgomery2016}.

\subsection{The four `low-instability' criteria}
The four criteria outlined in the previous subsection should be sufficient to define a regime where instability growth is expected to be minimised, and thus 1D simulation can be expected to be a reasonable estimate of performance. When exploring the parameter space, all implosions will be tested against these limits, and the best performing implosions within the regime defined by these criteria identified. Repeated for clarity, these four criteria are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\textrm{CR} < 16$
    \item $\textrm{IFAR} < 30$
    \item $v_{imp} < 400 \: \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second}$
    \item $I \cdot \lambda^2 < 1 \times 10^{14} \: (\unit{\watt\per\centi\meter\squared}) \cdot \unit{\micro\meter\squared}$
\end{itemize}



\section{Capsule design and laser pulse-profile}

\caption{Plots of a) the laser profile and b) the capsule design. The laser sequence consists of a laser being applied at the start of the simulation, leading to four pulses of increasing power. The power begins to increase at the times $t_1, t_2$ and $t_3$ (with a linear rise over 200 \unit{\pico\second}), and the laser is switched off at time $t_{off}$ (with a linear decay over 200 \unit{\pico\second}). The capsule has three layers, with material interfaces at  $R_{vapour}$ and $R_{foam}$ and an outer radius of $R_{capsule}$. When optimising this design, $R_{capsule}$ is selected and considered fixed. This is used to define the laser pulse powers $P_1, P_2, P_3$ and $P_4$, which are also not changed. This leaves seven optimisation parameters, which are indicated in teal: $t_1, t_2, t_3, R_{vapour}, R_{foam}$ and $\rho_{vapour}$ (the DT vapour density).}
\end{figure}

The simulation campaign involved optimising a series of capsule within the low-instability regime defined by the four instability criteria. To perform this optimisation, a laser pulse-profile and capsule were designed, with a number of parameters that could be varied between simulations. In this section, the design of this capsule and pulse-profile are described, and the optimisation parameters identified.

The capsule used for the simulations, displayed in Figure \ref{fig:CapsuleDesign}, was a simple three layer design consisting of a central DT-vapour region surrounded by a DT-wetted-foam layer and a deuterated plastic (CD) ablator. The simulation campaign actually consisted of a number of smaller optimisation campaigns for capsules of different outer radius; an outer radius was selected, and then the capsule and implosion were optimised with the outer radius considered a fixed parameter. During this optimisation, the interior dimensions of the capsule ($R_{vapour}$ and $R_{foam}$) were varied, and the density in the vapour region ($\rho_{vapour}$) was varied over the 0.6 \unit{\milli\gram\per\centi\meter\cubed} $< \rho_foam <$ 4.0 \unit{\milli\gram\per\centi\meter\cubed} range achievable with wetted-foam capsules. The wetted-foam layer had a fixed density of 0.253 \unit{\gram\per\centi\meter\cubed}, while the ablator had a density of 1.04 \unit{\gram\per\centi\meter\cubed}. This simple capsule design can be easily optimised, but is also a realistic design similar to those used in experiments\footnote{ The use of a central vapour region surrounded by a dense fuel layer is standard for ignition designs, but the choice of ablator can vary: these can include the use of HDC rather than plastic \cite{Mackinnon2014}, or can contain layers of dopants (such as silicon) to absorb hot-electrons and thus minimise preheating \cite{Solodov2022}.}. 

The laser pulse profile, displayed in Figure \ref{fig:LaserProfile}, consisted of a series of `steps' of constant laser power with a 0.2 \unit{\nano\second} linear rise time between each step. A 351 \unit{\nano\meter} nm laser was used, corresponding to the third-harmonic of Nd:glass. Both three- and four-pulse profiles were considered. The timings of each step ($t_1, t_2$ and $t_3$ in the figure) were treated as optimisation parameters, along with the time at which the laser was switched off ($t_off$). The relative laser powers were fixed and were not changed during the optimisation (the maximum power for the particular capsule radius was calculated from the intensity criteria, and the pulse profile was scaled accordingly). The pulse-powers were chosen to roughly reduce the amount of entropy injected into the fuel, and the overall design was chosen to be simple to implement and optimise, while also being feasible on current facilities. Ideally the pulse powers would also have been optimised, but adding an extra four optimisation variables was deemed to be infeasible.

The three laser timings, laser switch off time, internal capsule radii and DT vapour density resulted in seven optimisation parameters. During each optimisation, the capsule outer radius was selected and kept constant; this also defined the pulse powers. Simulations were then performed to identify the parameters of these seven variables giving the maximum possible yield while satisfying all four instability criteria. Since the capsule radius also defined the laser power and the approximate implosion time, it also defined a rough energy for the implosion to be optimised.


\section{Performing the simulation campaign}

\subsection{The simulation code HYADES}

The 1D Lagrangian radiation hydrodynamics code HYADES was used for this simulation campaign.  HYADES was developed and is supplied through Cascade inc., and for the purposes of this work was ran on the SCARF supercomputer at the UKRI-STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. It had previously been used for other large-scale simulation campaigns of ICF implosions \cite{Hatfield2019}. 

HYADES contains a number of different options for the various physics models. Those used in these simulations were based on the advice and recommendations of Dr Robbie Scott at the CLF. For this work, an average-atom LTE ionisation model was used, with a multi-group radiation diffusion approximation was used for radiation transport. A multiplier of 0.8 was also applied to the input laser energy to account for losses (such as those due to cross-beam energy transfer). A series of benchmarking simulations were performed after the main campaign to confirm that these settings were sufficient to describe experimental shots; theses are described in the appendix.

The DT vapour regions were described in the simulations using the in-line HYADES QEOS model, while the thin plastic shell was described as deuterated plastic and used the SESAME EOS table for CH. These are the standard, accepted ways of describing these materials. The wetted foam layer was less well-described, as no equation of state table for DT wetted foam was available. Instead, the DT wetted-foam layer was described as a conventional DT ice layer, described by the same DT QEOS model as for the DT vapour. The simulation therefore does not include the presence of the foam. This is a limitation of this work which is discussed further in later sections.

\subsection{Capsule meshing}

HYADES does not have an in-built meshing routine, and thus a meshing script had to be produced to allow different targets to be simulated. This mesh has two major requirements to ensure accuracy; the resolution of the mesh at the capsule outer edge should be sufficiently high, and the relative mass difference between zones should not be much greater than $\sim$ 2\%. In addition to this, an increased number of zones/mesh points leads to an increased simulation time, and thus it is desirable to keep the number of zones to a minimum while satisfying these two conditions.

A custom meshing routine was written for this simulation campaign. This routine was automatic and robust, allowing meshes to be created to describe capsules of a range of different sizes and layer thicknesses relevant to this investigation. The production of such a meshing algorithm was essential to being able to perform the large parameter scans that were the main feature of this work, as it enabled large numbers of capsules with different structures to be simulated with accuracy. The principles of this code (along with the underlying theory) is outlined in the \hl{appendix}.

The meshing algorithm produced worked sufficiently well for the campaign to be conducted. It operated less well as the thicknesses of the layers began to vary too drastically, but this did not prevent the optimisations being performed; if the thicknesses had changed drastically enough that for the meshing code to stop working well, the performance had always decreased to such an extent that it was clearly not worth investigating, or the criteria for implosion velocity/IFAR would have been exceeded. However, if simulations of drastically different designs were required, a new and more robust meshing algorithm would need to be developed.

\section{Conducting the simulation campaign}

The overall simulation campaign consisted of a number of smaller campaigns, each optimising a different capsule outer radius (and thus producing an implosion at a different energy). For each campaign, a rough initial simulation was created with reasonable initial parameters. Large parameter scans were then performed varying either the two layer thicknesses, or two of the three laser timings, over the course of around 100 simulations. The results of these would then be analysed on a series of plots considering the gain, convergence ratio, implosion velocity and IFAR as a function of the input parameters. Trends in these parameters were identified, and the simulations giving the optimal balance of yield and the instability criteria selected. A new round of simulations would then be performed varying further parameters, and the process repeated. This was an iterative process - optimising the laser timings would then often lead to a new optimal thickness, which in turn would lead to a change in the optimal laser timings again. This process was repeated until it stopped yielding capsules with better performance.

Througout this optimisation, the results would be monitored and the vapour density would also be investigated. For instance, if there were a number of capsules with lower yield than the current `optimal' design, but which also had a much lower convergence ratio than the limit of 16, then the vapour pressure would be reduced - this would increase the CR and gain of these capsules, and may result in them outperforming the previous best result. Equally, if a large number of the capsules satisfied the other criteria but the convergence ratio was too high, the vapour density would be reduced. This led to multiple repeats of the same round of optimisation at different vapour densities.

The time at which the laser was turned off was also treated separately from the other optimisation parameters. In all ICF implosions, there is a point after the peak implosion velocity is achieved at which the laser accelerates the shell no further. After this point, there is no benefit to applying the laser in terms of fusion performance - but doing so will increase the input energy, and thus decrease the gain. This effect could be substantial, and trends in the gain were being obscured based on how long after this point the laser was applied for. To resolve this, the laser was applied until the end of the each simulation, and the gain calculation was adjusted so that only the laser energy used up until the bang time was included in the calculation. This meant that the influence of this laser switch-off time was removed. Once the implosion had otherwise been optimised, the laser switch off-time would then be varied and the true gain (using the full applied laser energy) would be calculated; this would reveal a clear optimal value, and this would then be reported as the final gain and optimised implosion.

Care was also taken to ensure that appropriate time resolution was being used in all simulations, and that the simulation end time was appropriate. If the simulation ended before the capsule had properly converged, the gain would inevitably be too low. This could typically be spotted by unfeasible data (for instance, a very low convergence ratio). To test for this, a representative number of the simulations would be analysed individually to check that the full behaviour was being captured, and that the simulations looked appropriate.

This procedure generated the `optimal' design for a particular capsule radius, and a particular number of laser pulses. The procedure was repeated multiple times to generate optimal 3-pulse and 4-pulse sequences for a range of different capsule radii.

\subsection{Hydroscaling}

When this campaign was first conducted (in 2020) it was done from first principles for each capsule to minimise the number of assumptions on the optimal implosion. However, it was clear that all the capsules had comparable relative thicknesses and timings. In 2022, a further optimisation was performed to fill in a gap in the energies investigated, and this time hydrocaling relations were applied to produce an initial capsule from which to start the optimisation. This significantly reduced the rounds of simulations required to achieve convergence.

Hydroscaling makes use of the fact that much of the physics in an ICF implosion (particularly in 1D) is scale independent, and thus many of the parameters scale in a straightforward manner with capsule size. These relations state that $t \propto R \propto E^{1/3}$ where $t$ and $R$, are the implosion timings (including all laser timings) and capsule radii (including all internal boundaries) respectively, and $E$ is the laser energy \cite{Nora2014}. This meant that, based on the energy desired for the implosion, a rough estimate could be produced of the necessary capsule size. The interior dimensions of the capsule could be scaled accordingly, as could the laser timings. This was then used as the starting point of the optimisation to produce a capsule that already had a good level of fusion performance, which was then further increased by the optimisation.

\section{Results and analysis}

Over 20,000 simulations were performed in total, with over 10,000 satisfying all four instability criteria; these $\sim$10,000 valid simulations are plotted as a function of gain vs laser energy in Figure \ref{fig:loglog}. The data can be seen to form eight rough peaks, corresponding to the eight different outer radii (and thus energy scales) considered. The four-pulse laser sequences are displayed in black, while the three-pulse sequences are displayed in teal. As expected, the lower adiabat four-pulse sequences outperformed the three-pulse sequences at all energy scales. The best performing three-pulse and four-pulse simulation for each capsule size has been tabulated in Table \ref{tab:ThirdHarmonic}.

\caption{Simulation parameters used to achieve the maximum gains for each capsule size for both pulse sequences. The original capsule was the column with size multiplier of 1. New capsule sizes (and thus energy scales) were simulated by multiplying the radius by the size multiplier. In order to keep $I\lambda^2$ constant over different capsule sizes, the pulse powers were then multiplied by the square of the size multiplier. Gain is given to two significant figures, whilst convergence ratio, IFAR and implosion velocity are given to one decimal place. This level of precision is higher than would typically be quoted for a 1D simulation, but is used here to indicate how the values compare with the imposed limits. While convergence ratio is in places displayed as 16.0, the value to the precision calculated in the analysis is below this upper limit. The original simulation campaign was performed for five capsule sizes; three further sizes (0.25, 0.35 and 0.75) were performed later, but only four pulse sequences were optimized.}

\end{table}

These results demonstrate that high reactor-level gains can be achieved in this conservative regime, with a gain of 54 being achieved for an energy of 8.5 \unit{\mega\joule}. However, this is a much higher energy than is currently achievable, and is likely too high for an economically viable fusion reactor - suggesting that a fusion reactor could not be constructed using this particular approach. However, the lower energy performance is interesting. The gains of 0.19 and 0.75 at 0.77 \unit{\mega\joule} and 1.7 \unit{\mega\joule} respectively are impressive given the conservative nature of this regime. It is also worth noting that when this work was performed the record ICF gain was 0.03, and so this result suggested an improvement (at the time) of an order of magnitude. Recent developments have led to higher gains, but this suggests that comparable performance can be achieved in a conservative regime, where instability growth is less of a concern (and implosions would hopefully be robust). The recent NIF results (a gain of 0.7 at 1.9 MJ, and a gain of 1.5 at 2.05 MJ) actually fit just below the trend of this data (this is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ArF and Two colour} in the following chapter), suggesting that the performance of the current best shots is comparable to what is predicted here.

The conditions in the hotspot and shell of the 0.77 \unit{\mega\joule} capsule are displayed in \ref{fig:HSandShellLMJ}. It can be seen that the hotspot conditions are close to that required for ingition. The areal density is greater than the 0.3 \unit{\gram\per\centi\meter\squared} commonly quoted as required for ignition to occur, but the ion temperature (just below 4 keV) is slightly too low. This suggests that ignition could be within reach, if it was possible to increase this ion temperature just prior to the bang-time. This is investigated further in \hl{Chapter}. It is also interesting to note the relatively low areal density of the shell, which arises from the limited convergence of the capsule. This is most easily increased in this regime by increasing the size of the capsule.

It is useful to note again here the purpose of this work, which is not to claim that these exact gains are possible - these are the results of 1D simulations only, and thus can not be expected to be fully accurate. However, the expected low-instability growth means that such simulations are expected to be a more representative estimate of performance than would otherwise be the case, and thus should be sufficient to give a good first-estimate of potential experimental performance. Overall, these results show that it may indeed be possible to achieve interesting fusion performance (comparable to the current best-performing shots on the NIF) in this conservative regime, based around low-convergence ratio and where performance is expected to be minimal.

\section{Limitations and suggested future work}
There are a number of limitations of this work, some of which will be investigated further in the following chapters. These limitations also suggest potential avenues for future research.

Firstly, the fundamental limitation of this work is the use of 1D simulations. While the effort made here to define a low-instability regime means that 1D like-behaviour is expected, this is still a fundamental assumption upon which this work relies. While 1D simulations are sufficient for an initial investigation of the regime as has been conducted here, to explore it with greater confidence simulations in higher dimensions are required. We have recently secured access to the University of Rochester's RIGEL code, and plan to use this for confirmatory 2D simulations.

Secondly, the direct-drive nature of this work coupled with the high laser energies makes experimental verification of the regime challenging. When this work was performed, the use of cryogenic targets and the high energies meant that performing shots based on these designs would not be possible, due to a lack of cryogenic capabilities for direct-drive shots at the NIF \cite{Hohenberger2015}. Fortunately this has since been rectified, and direct-drive shots of wetted-foam targets are being planned. However, this still requires cryogenic shots on the NIF, which makes limits the opportunity to test this regime. An alternative solution to this is proposed in the next chapter. In addition, such shots would need to be performed in a PDD configuration. This is contrary to these simulations, where fully symmetric direct-drive was assumed (and the benchmarking simulations in Appendix \ref{app:benchmark} suggest that a reduced laser input multiplier would potentially be required to describe PDD shots).

Thirdly, the simulations make a number of approximations that are not particularly accurate, which likely lead to some over-estimation of the performance. The two main ones are as follows: 1) the laser in the 1D simulations is focussed at the centre of the capsule, which means that it remains perfectly focused as the capsule implodes. This is unphysical. However, the benchmarking simulations in Appendix \ref{app:benchmark} suggest that the input multiplier used to account for this is reasonable for in the case of a spherical direct-drive implosion, although a lower multiplier may be required for a polar direct drive setup. 2) The description of the wetted foam as simply a DT layer (with the CH foam not accounted for) is a poor one, and is only valid if the foam density is below $\sim10$~\si[per-mode=symbol]{\milli\gram\per\centi\meter\cubed} \cite{CHFoamLim}. Other groups have used a less-compressible mixed CH + DT equation of state to describe this material with more accuracy \cite{Olson2021}; this is investigated in the following section. This is further complicated by the fact that the equation of state for even dry foams at these low densities are not well simulated, which motivated the experiment in later chapters. Further study is required to better describe this material if wetted-foams are to be simulated to higher accuracy, and ultimately experiments to measure the wetted foam equation of state are required; this is enough topic that we are continuing to investigate.

In addition, while these are presented as `optimisation' campaigns, exploring such large parameter spaces manually is incredibly difficult, and thus no guarantee can be made that optimal performance has been obtained. This approach would be well-suited to a machine learning approach, which could automate the optimisation process and hopefully explore the parameter space more efficiently. Machine-learning has been applied to ICF for similar problems in the past successfully \cite{Hatfield2019}, and this is something that we are currently investigating within our research group. If this could be done successfully, it would allow many more simulation campaigns to be performed of this ilk with relative ease. The impact of more parameters could be explored (for example, the laser pulse powers), and the criteria applied to limit the parameter space could be adjusted (i.e. to investigate alternative maximum implosion velocities) or to include other parameter (for instance, applying a minimum permitted adiabat).

In addition, while the regime identified is expected to be result in low-instability growth, there are other parameters which could be included to increase confidence in this. The most obvious would be the adiabat of the implosion. In addition, no limit was placed on the strength of the first shock, as the impact of particular asymmetry seeds was not considered in this work. This is a significant limitation, since the strength of the first shock has been shown to be key to mitigating instabilities from the support tent (in indirect implosions) and ablator micro-structure. If future simulation campaigns were to be performed (particularly if machine learning was to be applied), repeating this campaign with a 10 Mbar first shock should be a priority.

\section{Conclusion}
A simulation campaign to investigate the performance of wetted-foam capsules in a low-instability regime was presented, where the regime is defined by low convergence ratio, IFAR, implosion velocity, and laser intensity. While the laser energy necessary for an IFE reactor based on this approach is not feasible, the performance at lower energies is comparable to the recent record shots on the NIF. This suggests that substantial fusion performance can be obtained despite the conservative approach taken here, and that further exploration of this regime could be interesting. A variety of potential extensions and improvements to this work have been suggested, many of which are explored in the following chapter.

This chapter has also demonstrated the utility of such an optimisation campaign - a general platform which can be used to explore fusion performance in a particular parameter space. This approach has again been applied in the subsequent chapter to explore variations on the implosion scheme discussed here.

%\caption{Simulation parameters used to achieve the maximum gains for each capsule size for both pulse sequences. The original capsule was the column with size multiplier of 1. New capsule sizes (and thus energy scales) were simulated by multiplying the radius by the size multiplier. In order to keep $I\lambda^2$ constant over different capsule sizes, the pulse powers were then multiplied by the square of the size multiplier. Gain is given to two significant figures, whilst convergence ratio, IFAR and implosion velocity are given to one decimal place. This level of precision is higher than would typically be quoted for a 1D simulation, but is used here to indicate how the values compare with the imposed limits. While convergence ratio is in places displayed as 16.0, the value to the precision calculated in the analysis is below this upper limit.}
