%\subsection*{Personal}

I have worked with a huge number of brilliant people over the last few years - far too many to list in full here. Many thanks to all of you; those I collaborated with, those I had discussions with, and those I had email conversations with. It was great working with you all, and I hope to continue to do so going forward. Particular thanks to everyone who worked through the uncertainty of the pandemic and overcame constantly-changing travel restrictions to take part in the VULCAN experiment; it was touch-and-go for a while, and I'm very glad it ended up being worth all the hassle! Thanks also to the Norreys' group past and present (particularly Ben, Ramy and Marko), and to the wider ALP sub-department for all the help, support and companionship.

Huge thanks is of course due to Peter Norreys, who I had the good fortune to have as my supervisor. Thank you Peter - for all the guidance, the constant ideas, and for introducing me to so many great people. Thanks for accommodating my interests and giving me the freedom to pursue them, whether that was finding a way to do some experimental work, or allowing me to disappear off to parliament for three months. Most of all, thanks for the constant support and encouragement over the last few years.

Finally, thanks to all my family and friends - for all the love, encouragement and support. You know who you are!

%Over the course of my PhD, I have had the chance to work with a large number of incredibly helpful and talented scientists - far too many to list in full here. I would like to thank each and every one of you; those I collaborated with, those I had discussions with, and those I simply badgered over email. It was great working with all of you, and I hope to continue to do so going forward. Particular thanks is due to everyone who worked through the uncertainty of the pandemic and overcame constantly-changing travel restrictions to take part in the VULCAN experiment. It was touch-and-go for a while, and I'm very glad it ended up being worth all the hassle! Thanks also to the Norreys' group past and present (particularly Ben, Ramy and Marko), and to the wider ALP sub-department. You were all very helpful, and made the whole process much easier than it otherwise might have been.

%Any PhD student will tell you how highly dependent the experience is on their supervisor, and I had the extreme good fortune to have Peter Norreys as mine. Thank you Peter. Thanks for the all the guidance, for the constant flow of new ideas, and for all the great people you've introduced me too. Thanks for giving me the freedom to do what interested me, and committing to it 100\%: be that allowing me run off to parliament for three months, or taking my desire to do some experimental work and finding a way to make it possible. Finally, thanks for the constant support, and for believing in me even if I didn't always believe in myself.

%I've never been one for long lists of personal acknowledgements, and so I'll keep this as short as possible. Huge thanks of course to my family and all my friends, for all the love and support throughout the years. You all know who you are - and if you need to read it here then frankly, I'm doing something wrong.




%\subsection*{Institutional}

%If you want to separate out your thanks for funding and institutional support, I don't think there's any rule against it.  Of course, you could also just remove the subsections and do one big traditional acknowledgement section.
